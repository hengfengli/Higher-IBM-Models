Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the proposed cancellation of the paragraph on the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs refused in second reading the draft amendment to the reduction of penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having disadvantageous concluded an agreement in principle with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court shall decide on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko as the judgment of political revenge of the regime and led a process of suspicion of bias of the court also to the west.
The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the ex-Premere Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have required 226 votes for approval.
Victory Libyan
The release or Libyan rebellion already has its losers.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the election winners are Islamists, but it is of moderate or radical.
The provisional National Council declared the ordinary law of Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because a flight is cut the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible not respectful of faith are punishable by the death penalty.
It is the Quran which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator society composed of tribes opposing.
In Libya is such an order as we cannot represent him and as we would surely not.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for the Libyan.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted with appreciation the assistance dogs infidels.
The only excuse is that this is not a americian general who led the NATO strikes but Allah they celebrated the magnitude to each attack.
When it is to seek the winners in Libya, the West is not part
We have participated in the fire, used Islam and our poilitiques have diverted the dictator as a political ally but it brings no benefit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily Libya.
There was therefore not a problem for the premises to be rid of "crusaders."
Does without occupation of soil, the oil companies will have access to black gold libyien.
Perhaps not provided and the West can finally boast a desinteressee protection of human rights.
For if we prevent these enthusiasts of sharia law.

Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They have created a human shield

They want support by this gesture their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students started at noon to pray at the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
Some hundreds of students from the universities of Isfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in Esfahan where uranium is processed.
They have openly expressed that they would defend the program nuclaire of their countries at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Were reported in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

The feeding a child obese: does not not take breakfast and takes to the deli for lunch
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems of overweight, 9% of écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese.
As the current research shows the obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important is the changing environment in which humans and the surrounding models.
Of the tables of obese children are for example of the deli 50% more often than in the families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese had of french fries for dinner in the investigation with an advocacy "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of small large sport is also not a habit, which is now the case in most of today's students, only 15% responded that at least once a week the parents find the time for active movement.
Survey on 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and participated 900 students of primary schools in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a chance," action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever.
 Since the beginning is more than 12,000 students from sixth to the third who have enrolled in the project.
One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and obese children, is the lack of a proper food and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicates for example eat five times a day small dejeuner-en cases-Lunch-gouter- dinner, which is one basic principles of good food," said one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and deli at dinner
The experts drew attention to the fact that to have a healthy development requires a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of families of the students eat in my time.
In the majority of families each took his breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been identified is that a tenth of the population takes no breakfast at all.
The breakfast is the basis of good food daily.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of the obese children is more often unhealthy fries.
Almost every student, not to mention the weight, drinking sugary beverage each day (70%).
Over 40 percent of the children questioned regularly made sport but for the parents it is of half, only 15%.
Prepares you your food
Another part of the survey helped the children selected (204 males and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from alternatives according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far, in terms of healthy eating, the ideal."
Among their favorite meals there are a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
"The more alarming is including a greater preference for the sweet lemonades," is shown in the results of the investigation.
For lunch is pasta which took the first place just before the white meat.
Children have not at all appropriate starch and the preference for fish and vegetable meal was very low.
Town on health
The survey also showed that the children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of participants in the survey that had completed the questionnaire after the advocacy meeting" Obesity is not a chance, "were attended a definite will to move towards a healthy eating," indicate the results of the investigation.
The most striking was by example as regards the lemonades sweet because the children have begun to give preference to water consumption.
Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and reduce sweetened foods and "knedliky" (Czech specialte pellets of potato bread or flour).
The designer should be also a good psychologist, say the professionals
In an article reporting on how to learn for the designers, I put myself a little angry by the fact that there were many from the beginning.
I didn't really think about what would happen afterwards.
Presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of characters and a seminar on what is happening locally.
And it will be worse.
As we approach the final exams and more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays is truly "full."
This time we have with the Director Alenka (over there is no boy) Treaty of how to dress the women who did not measurement standards.
And women of this type is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without particular curve, another of overweight.
The designer must know how optically ammenuiser arms wide, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We arrivals and to highlight nicely the character and also not to dress too conspicuous types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips made and a fine size.
If there is such a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that the skirts or pants are not at all, this is the time to be custom.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that is impeccably is invaluable.
In a tailored skirt you feel much better that in that is permanently, spirals and is not in the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a clothing style Tucker, with pieces of fabric sewn, or even of embroidery.
There is obviously much examples of'apparences variety and I am pleased that I have the week to sort all information received.
But I also fear that, having regard to what I should do at home there are too many.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of mode of personality and appearance.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know of the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
In substantive, it pleased me, because it is better than to dress up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who recently took almost one hundred kilograms (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously), or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or search the web, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say in the final outcome, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphics.
Graphic reflect also on the part of the styling is also important.
The designer dresses not only the physical but creates productive example the pages in the magazines (on specific products trends for carry-on bags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, designer and graphic designer, spoke of this.
However,... until Sunday
The designer must have a vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the meeting on Saturday full of information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that the mode is an illusion and the designer should know how to use it.
And a talented designer is work with a single clothing in a different way.
The variability is important for this example.
As such trench coats that must be raised from conventionally with a jeans and T-shirt as a lightweight coat but can also pay the naked body, with escarpins and take the photo as a dress.
Or is to roll up the sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it" he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules well."
"You can then begin to break," said Jakub.
Finally I understand why it seeks to learn the rules, what to do with, where, why, when, in the fashion magazines is sometimes seen something else.
No statement on the fashion shows.
I know of new, through fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have many more variants of clothing that are photographed.
It is to say that for fashion story to be a dozen or so pages (i.e. a dozen models) I must be ready to "retailler" at least a fortnight.
And, a clothing and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality.
We must reckon with this in the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna which is not a great singer but its image and marketing have made it a global star.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of services of designers are still cautious.
And the familiar faces the sometimes regard as unnecessary (is that I know something but what I sound is the second highest).
And if someone gets a styling of our hand, we must then rely on the fact that it dictates with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than it is in reality.
There is then to navigate on google and ascertain whether the news of Boulevard refer to the celebrity in question, if she lost weight or grown etc...
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to move in the mode and assemble models.
It must communicate with the people he dresses and it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowledge guess the people, not to pander, retain its opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his cabinet and completion of new things you cannot throw everything and say, My God what horror."
"You will find some cases you will find attractive and you conseillerez it with what the bear," said Mario.
He showed us specifically what must contain the so-called "placovka" or bag of designer.
This is that you hang around the waist and you on itself for everything you need.
In addition the things clearly defined as scissors, rolls to depilation or even the pins to nurse, there is also the nylon yarn (the designer used to photograph products such as bags, or many hats), special clips with which it closes a garment in the back, it is too high (the pin or other type of bar are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or a sewing kit.
For we are not only of people who listen to but who tried something in practice they have taught us how ressemeller properly of footwear.
And during the photo opportunity in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we bonded and stuck.
We did not have the right to receive the scissors to not inadvertently hurt.
It must therefore truly of skills.
Mario has pleased me when he congratulated me for my creation.
The jurisdiction which I am condition is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a brief summary of what we have learned during the second weekend of the
Increasingly I began to understand that making the styling a profession is not a walk in the garden of roses, everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run competes across the America.
Revision
Originally a race without problem becomes due to a series of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do a routine morning shift at work.
This is to some extent the ambition of each but it achieves nothing if nobody wants to do something more.
The new Part subtitled The Run produced high expectations before his release.
He promised to take a new direction with the racing series Need for Speed already old and out a kind of game from parties jouables which not only would have with points.
We were curious how the crossings will be added during which the main hero out of his car and done what it wanted.
As is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what is atttendait.
This are potentially of racing games arcades but the whole derives downwards due to some unnecessary errors that already exist for several years.
This are not really of errors but rather an expression of a idleness incomprehensible by the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has emotional problems and to resolve them is to participate in illegal racing across the America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco and your mission is to be the first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.
This resulting that each race is on another route and the stages in different environments that are quite far from each other and are interesting.
The player did not feel a moment that the game offered something identical to it.
Some environments are quite nice even if the level of addition graphic technique is of the same type as the previous series.
Finally this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in landscapes of fall or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant visually.
Tests are also from time to time with a non-standard element.
For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm which you significantly decreases the visibility.
May in the mountains you must pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.
In addition to this the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There is only a small number but it is enough.
There are moments you seek to exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a conventional race) and you stand against the shows (classic duel with the stopwatch) and yet you expected another duel with an adversary.
From time to time you also the police entering the game and trying to make the situation difficult.
The novelty are the passages out vehicle.
It is rather to una interactive animation when most of the time Jack fled to someone and you have to help by typing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing fancy.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type that you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
In result is as this because this element is not likely to interfere with and, in the context described above, in the elements that enhances the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that currently there is nothing special but we cannot say that this is negative.
Regarding the simulation realistic you should go see elsewhere.
But although can find better in the conccurrence the model of conduct goes very well with the design type of races.
So everything is ok.
The problems start to appear after a certain time.
At the diffference of model of conduct, the collision is not yet finalized.
We do not expect of this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the idea of how is your car, it is not completely right.
During overruns tight you are sometimes mutually slightly but otherwise perform your car in part of the crazy acrobatics.
Or is in tatters.
Through the system of recovery this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is to ensure that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the stage the game will take you back to the time of the last point on the route.
But you do only have to 5 start-ups.
When you used the 5 start-ups you must resume the game since the beginning.
It is therefore more a tool, for the case where something is not happening as it should be, that quelquechose that you can really count on.
Sometimes the start-ups do not help and it must find the solution in rememorrant memory the piece of route in question.
The general problem of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example there are some turns that it must move from a certain way or it does not.
Otherwise you encounter on a given location of vehicles still "civilians" in the same way that you come first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What angry are the situations where you see easily get the opponent between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you must be set aside and the conturner or curb.
It is equal if you go out of him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it is always close to your nose.
Opponents still have other benefits.
Throughout the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent ahead at the same location.
This getting nervous most end of game when you drive on a long bridge in opposite direction.
The opponent must at any price before you go.
When it passes you you obstructs the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter colliding a number of times.
It can understand that the purpose of the game is to do something exciting and full of adredaline, but it is clear that bored quickly comes.
And injury because it is through a simple model of conduct the game is interesting and areas with both action that you do not have the time to follow everything that happens.
And is equal if it is because of the unique concept of 50 routes, the order of the races is such that there is no chance to get bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You must pay attention to the fuel pumps on the car because you can change routes, however, most of the time that you can.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are ideal for the cities, the gas-guzzlers straight American to highways and the super sports cars to exotic garb on the lines very technical yaw e.g. on roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are racing in specific locations that you know of the adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only of medals but also points of experience in addition to your profile which is common to the challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, various objects begin to unlock:
Which connects on-line with the Autolog Service which among others compare your results with those of other players and you have other functions in the community.
One of blows the more difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You have your car in the subway tunnel (it is) where you drive in the dark on tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator you said between 150 and 200 kph (in principle) and behind you is an underground train which sends you the car directly to scrap.
At the preparation we had a discussion for a few days to determine if someone truly has reflected in the creation of this game or if we really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really cool.
What embarrassment is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases dramatically.
This focuses on accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery you use more to nothing.
Part sound is good and the track is the choice.
In order to appeal to the greatest number and particularly the young people a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mixed everything," but we can expect that no one will buy the stake for music.
General Printing of Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game had not the stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best production of NTS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not be finished.
Fun is really good but prepare you to what the mistakes you in the eyes gets with the force of a reflector airfield.

Vicenova, Ambassador near the European Union:
The Czechs behave as negativistes and the Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically deleted the balance between the institutions"
"I did not expect to a war as hard."
"This last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players are accustomed to their new role," is how Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law Czech Ambassador about the European Union.
When she was able to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations so visible and understandable, to the point that a large number of speakers at the Faculty of Law of the Charles University may envy, it has shown how it takes its motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning sounded the criticism it is bland, that is a rond-de-cuir, that it cannot rempplir mission and I must say that it has cut the time to everyone because it takes its role to perfection."
"This is a man who knows listen to 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take to Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defense Policy in the framework of an answer to the question: "Who is that in the European Union?" "What do I call telephone number?," as an important step towards unity and greater clarity of the policy of the Union in the face of statements, as is China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese to pulp cooked smells very strong)
Madam Vicenova also referred to the agenda that has been, is and will live in a near time the European Council.
She described the Czech Presidency to two years ago of success.
The Czech resolved the mounting financial crisis, the gas crisis or have held a Summit for a Partnership Oriental.
She described the fall of the Government of very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of Madam Ambassador, "the activity reached its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now.
It takes more approve the new budget septimal of the Union which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and for economies, the branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to resolve in the framework of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled its slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe understandable."
"I don't really like the abbreviations, the foreign words, that nobody understands dialects.
As must understand the citizens that it is true that nobody in Brussels the pickles round or twisted, of bananas differently or large although nobody has prohibited from making syrecky."
It to better use EU environment and see more of Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe we expected
The Ambassador Czechs have the reputation of being the Eurosceptics and of people who do things that in their negative than positive.
Moreover it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is, she says, to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support for the Czech party.
In addition to a Czech Presidency to success then stressed the force and the cooperation of the Visegrad group.
"Believe me, when the Poles come to me, the Magyar, the Slovak, the French said to me: 'Wow, what you do there, that is still the Visegrad Group?" and it is not at all happy ".
According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future it is hard for new rules on fiscal policy facing the member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is prevailing multi-speed, rather than a "new European Federation."
"We have countries in the euro area and other outside of the area."
"We the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
Firstly, it was said that cooperation among the countries that want and those who do not wish to remain in their corner."
"There will be many institutes of this type and there will be a two-speed Europe really" is Mrs Vicenova.
From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not only the member of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone should seek the word which is closer to the nearest IBM strategy, would be "the long term."
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and, since its establishment 100 years have elapsed.
The basis of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr..
It left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company soignement developed by Watson.
For us IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived hundred years due to the fact that it was always true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all around it.
This allowed us during our first century to transform the technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "has delare for the anniversary the current Director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A system well prepared
Watson, in the 1930s, began to deal with its employees as Bata in Czech Republic, the people of IBM were the only American among the first employees to be paid holidays, insurance paid by the employer or an employee consistently elegant and a well developed system of rewards to inventors and commmerciaux.
In the same way IBM has a well developed system of relationships with the client.
The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since this will be a femme- Virginia Rometty, who should replace Palmisano to the head of IBM.
It is working with IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, brain- storming online from what are many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas, in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is internal and external image of the company that provide a secure position in the areas of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather than a firm institution technology," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps solve the problems of the world of business using its technology," added Geogre Colony of the Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As said the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create the market.
IBM, or the "Big Blue," as it is colloquially in the United States with regard to its slogan- in 100 years it has grown to become one of the largest global firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm, it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, counselling at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
It has many patents of all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries ranks such as distributor of tickets, the card payment, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM has recovered this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Overview in advance
Not all innovations and fabrications which were customer preference and IBM at the time-for example failed the bet on a system operational service's own OS/2, Prodige online or of the IBM computer PCjr:
"From the moment when your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain fixated on the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it is.
Unlike example of conccurent Microsoft that the basis is and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
Income In the IBM, the services, which are trained to a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 it was with more than the motie of participation the highest representative of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM has sold low-yielding assets for $15 billion, over cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology opportunities.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiated according to the precepts of its first head Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment.
It appears now that IBM is the current crisis without incident?
The price of the action IBM progesse from 2008 in rocket 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the firm IBM is to change everything, but not its values.
It can expect for this that giant flexible control other crises.
IBM History: From the slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
The IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City 100 years ago; it was originally the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924, initially it was a trade mark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and in South America.
The basis for future IBM was the merger of four firms which is linked to the 80 year history of the 19th century.
They possessed of technologies such as the old "pointeuses," clocks which recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint that until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of society.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.
The leader was then to shadow the founder of the firm, is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and culture of the society.
Watson led the firm kusqu'en 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production of all machinery possible for business and trade, of cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years during which Watson led, turnover has multiplied up to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was irreplaceable for the firm if that after 40 years of direction is her son who held the chair of Director, Thomas Watson Jr..
Under his leadership IBM began the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first language programming.
In the 1960s people and the IBM computers helped NASA has guided the flights in the cosmos, on Mercury, Saturn and the flight on the Moon in 1969.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The PC classic which determined the standard computer of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its manufacture of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased society of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The successful strategy at IBM over the past three years, is the concept Smarter Planet "smarter planet."
Its objective is the uilisation smart technology in areas not yet exploited such as the transport and management of cities.
Regarding trade IBM has developed some time ago a platform "Smarter Commerce" trade that helps to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, also IBM RT, there is also the strategic center for outsourcing of Brno.

Rychtarova on her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it is finished.
After that her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and return to the house.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her house, she had no idea that the couple would not.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted move from Ricany, Pepa not only postponed the singer.
And it admitted in public that he loved him.
With the time Darina has resigned, accepted the binding of her husband and eventually to say goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer.
If Rychtar and Bartosova split there will be no wife to the host on outside the door of the house.
"It is my son's biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, nobody will be outside."
"It will not be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," a leaked Rychtarova by showing that it is detached from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina had closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I will remain with Iveta and will change not."
"My wife has established a marriage on paper and I respect."
"The company continues, I am responsible for repairs, the garden, the estate, I buy."
"With Darina discussed in a completely normal way but we do not set down together" said Rychtar to Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it will not prevent the.
"We do not set down together and it does not interest me to know where she is, and if it has a link.
I know that it is my fault, I fell in love ("Iveta and I take all the responsibility on me," said Joseph.
The worst vices of women: This also for you?
If you ask men to identify defects typical of women, all alike, are able to get them out of their hole."
My dear ladies, you know in the following lines of defects women arriving to pump the blood veins of men.
Purchases
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you buy at least one garment per week?
You are simply buying and packet at the time of balances?
In your case you can speak of purchases as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
But you say, which would to leche-vitrine in clothing stores, to seek for oneself fine clothing and then try them all in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buy is a hobby, it may become a hell for the man.
Remember only how many times have you said to your spouse that he expected at the entrance.
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too big?"
"I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms, I should start to make the sport?"
"I like you?"
These sentences do not remind you something?
Yes?
You are therefore part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop to look after yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still to complain about her appearance.
The stronger sex do not hesitate to say that increase the frequency of these complaints and more women become empoisonnantes.
The orders and cleanliness in the first place
Infinite It is like a merry-go-round.
Wash windows, vacuuming, clean soil, to dust, scraping the bathroom, and this twice a week.
You made the remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on own soil, the children they have soiled the sink, clogged the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
Should you have precisely this obsession, try to keep in mind that it should not be exaggerated and that the order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This innocent desire of cleanliness may spoil your relations, however, and even family peace.
The work to undermine
"Met the top spent in the dustbin."
"You accounts put these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do with land."
If you made on your partner this undermining of this way several times a day, you really break it down.
It is clear that you don't think about poorly you want everything is impeccable.
Perhaps if men knew, women would not have to do so much work to undermine.
Defamation, the persiflage
Defamation, the persiflage but also the insults against someone is also a characteristic of some women.
Women are brought particularly in relations and are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us leak a small persiflage innocent here and there.
The hand on the heart it is a feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise other and are for them, particularly to work in a group of women-particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The attacker hokeyiste Jagr participated twice in the victory of Philadelphia during the Monday's NHL game on ice and Carolina is again in productive head of Czech players for the competition.

A moment later there was a second attack of the Czech team.

A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a downhill, but the beginning of the second part fell to the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.

"I am really happy with it."
"I want to play on him."
'All these years the NHL other players of the team tried to play on me, now it is my turn, "said Jagr.
Caroline was a tragedy of this game because with a purpose of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a shooting of penalty it concluded with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not exclude other complications that ended by two to one.
"Excellent Pronger has carried out attacks in our area."
It has tapped the puck travels at speeds, I took of the speed and (Read) went to the most remote corner of the cage.

The Candiens did not face an experienced advocate their advance of two butset lost after a fire of penalty by 2: 3.
Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the rear line was ill that has especially debt the entraineur local instead of points lost because they played the game with only five defenders.
"It is nil."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest was youth."
"But there is nothing to be done, it is like that," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement this was not sufficient and we could not resist."
"We just to simplify the game, pushing the puck travels at speeds beyond our area."
For this we had the limits, "said one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender attended the thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different gunmen participated uax purposes of the Jets, who issued a series of five matches lost.
How have evolved travel prices since 1989
Until Czechoslovakia in 1989 there were only 5 travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at the time offering travel especially in countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists were traveling for the holiday in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and in Hungary (Balaton).
A large exception to the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have a penchant for western and travel to the Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not authorized for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechs) travel individually even in the framework of socialist countries.
In the case where the citizen Tchécoslovaque wanted to travel individually by example in Poland and the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation or the individual trip was not authorized.
Travel agencies at this time also offered tours to the West, however, should be queuing all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after what was not yet won.
The agreement for the currency which was the condition for travel to the west was "politically incorrect" denied to people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency exchangeable was not, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of Western currency (currency) to travel to the west.
Czechs often spent their holidays in the country where there were so many country houses and cottages that Czechs are purchased, and this usually lasts until now.
Travel of Czechs have since been since 1989 a major revolution.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the maximum, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of vacation in countries around the world.
The great paradox which we do not realize now is that the country's most popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave for short visits especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs could not long travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example in Paris the Czechs travel organizations were sleeping in tents in parks because our income allowed us not to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of Czechs travel was at that time to win with itself its own food cans, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna which has enabled our tourists finally after decades of Western power freely buy of the currency.
Our standard of living and the average salary increased which led around the year 1997 another important moment.
Through a growing demand for travel travel agencies since 1997 began preparing for the towers with links by air charter which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what there was before.
At the end of 90 years of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries of the world from the US who later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting time in the history of post-revolution, when tourism was prepared the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as each year of direct air charter take of Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100,000 Czechs alien who visit the country each year.
Once an interesting time in this period which symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the US have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fall completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for holidays abroad including annexes loads. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but it may end in a situation without "a pat solution"
Nearly 5mois already Czech football is without President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after another General Assembly scheduled to take place Thursday at Nymburk.
However there is still no agreement on the settlement of vote is required.
Without this agreement it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure urged colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to the differences between the chambers of the Association which cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This has fully shown on 16 September when it had to choose a new president.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and it was not even issue to deal with how to elect.
There was no agreement on the fact of who has the right to vote in the General Assembly, only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since this time also with the assistance of the Office for the state and the law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue about the regulation on the election.
It is clear too that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned negotiation or extraordinary, is not made either to the situation
Opinions on the possibilite of vote have changed several times, but the key point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed to the third round not to fall in the pat.
"The bone of contention is in the following fact: follow the statutes or find another model," was one of three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the model planned won the third round the candidates who received the highest number of votes in proportion to the Chamber to which he or she is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw in order that is the candidate who receives the largest percentage of votes in both chambers.
And the Czech part is the requirement that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely refuse the bicameral concept," says Svoboda that includes the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agree even if it considers that the regulation of elections based on the articles most Pelta advantage among all candidates.
Than I would like to vote according to the statutes of the association ".
"For that there is not yet a whimsical ideas conceived by a representative as in past General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and in its submissions was defined primarily against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification possible today in European Championship should calm everyone."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there one more more excitement for a cooperation," says the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the greatest football management experience in both professional and at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are patterns to change the regulations to design."
"This may lead to new a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I hope that the healthy reason will win" said Rajchl.
There is not much time for a common agreement to all parties.
Some reuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell whether the entire leadership of football will be full for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which should travel to Podgorice inter alia the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not departed for technical reasons and sought an alternative to take a part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation.
At the end is the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the parties torn in the strongest sports association of the countries and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports which is to determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because it sees no candidate correct.
If the head of footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly that the profile would have responded to everything that he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in campaign to this high office.
"If there is such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I do not come to the election."
But in the current situation, it has not been possible to find such a candidate, "said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent precisely Pelta access to the head of the AFRT which in principle would be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that if under the elections would be held the position of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
It would be well in the service an experienced manager and of high-level but is not linked to the world of football.
"I have discussed with people who have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
This, it is said, is especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and President of the Union regional football of Plzen Roman Berbr, rights to the controversial reputation that is known in the scenes as lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President.
"If he won, the state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of high-powered Berbr, which is a merchant, it would be even less favourable to football," proclaimed Paclik.
What the shocks still is the fact that the name of Pelta has been pronounced in tapping a few years ago as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta was left without any penalty.
"I do not know what prestige Pelta would football."
"And how would we be regarded in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the should Paclik triumph to Thursday's vote, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September which ended in a fiasco, think the same thing.
"It (Pelta) would be the first with which I would."
"It has large capacity"
"It would be able to present such as head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association would not be able."
"I am not the nose in what I don't know," said Paclik which attracted great attention in September when it agreed to the cancellation of the Referees Commission with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik states that it would be at the level to lead the Association.
It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that it also heads since last year the club of Plzen who celebrated with his support in May its triumph in first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture."
"I freinerais the influence of certain interest groups that have for example tend to affect the Disciplinary and Appeals, which leads to situations of bad taste," said Paclik that chache not its antipathy to the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power to lobby with high-level policy would provide more money for the sport of tax on the games.
"It is one of the key points of the new President should be."
"If it is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not present its link with the club of Plzen as something negative even if he claims that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties."
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
I see no reason to give my club Plzen's actions to someone if I must return a year and a half after, "said Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to situations of pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association football one of the candidate to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes which should end in the future to disputes about the rules for the elections.
The employee of Jablonec is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believe today that the success of the football representation should calm this squabble before the vote.
Pelta before the election in September which has not carried out promised precisely to focus on the national representation and access to financial resources if it is elected.
It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and the delay of two months might enable him to defend his vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels of football are long and expect Thursday there is a President."
"They feel that it is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he adds, but it is primarily associated with the club of Jablonec, worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that existed at sought to Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately the" General Assembly of June of statutes were approved which were not perfect as all realized."
"If there were not these various interpretattions we already had a president since September," Pelta said.
It is precisely the review the most important document of the civic association that has caught the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities in the case where it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta said.
Then tries, it is said, not to face its opponents.
He said previously that it may cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl it recognizes with respect to its training in law and that it knows that its adversaire-candidat would be its first Vice-President.
It has not attacked long Tonas Paclik which on the contrary continues to criticize Pelta.
"It evolves in football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks were not the most honorable and has surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said in the address of his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the declarations he made in September.
Its the greatest weapon he stated is his knowledge of football competition from the lowest level to the national representation.
This should be a vitirne football.
And also I would endeavor to complete all cases that begin with that of Bohémians or following the scandal of corruption."
"I entrerais immediately into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for any football," told the Czech News Agency CTK reported the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of the football would not change for people.
"I should meet with all employees," he said at Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there is catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he said that the delegates will not Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is a single point of discord over how to vote in the third round we will be able to surpass."
"Football needs credibility and it will not get that when there is a new leader at its head," as the states of optimistically Pelta two days before the decisive day probably for his career as a public servant.
Rajchl promised that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday it would not resonate with many people, it seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the case where it would be elected will begin to work hard.
It is systemic change and make the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for different areas of football.
It also promised to resolve the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA soccer, make more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to play football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation, of professional football and a successful football youth."
"But I am not saying that I will do this only" Rajchl said in an interview for KTC.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the expertise within the Executive Committee so that each member is responsible for a specific area."
"And I will hand out difficult missions for football face a major step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy, because it will be hard to begin work rather than criticize others," he added.
It reported, said, that he would not stand again as a candidate because of a critical mood.
"A about me, you know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if this is the time and if I have the people behind me that I will constantly sticks in the wheel and issue of doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he was afraid.
"A lot of people have said to me that I must not give up because they would also."
"It is a confidence that I cannot betray," he said.
What motivates the, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Over the last two years there has been a lot of fact and I do not want to let him down."
"There are processes which have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone stop.'," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it is something that Mirek Pelta is not do."
"Behind him are people who fairaient football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been selected."
"I can blame a number of things but certainly not to bear quelq'un."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for all because everyone will be pleased not only those who have been selected
And it confirms once again that it would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do the maximum to Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian the other which the winners would be in first division."
"There would be no situation as now with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess its own chances of winning.
"I feel permanently support of the Czech Chamber which elected me as its Executive Vice President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl considering among its future success to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiation of contracts with televisions and on the Gaming Act.
It said instead that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all.
While said about Pelta "it is disqualified as the Czech footblal would lose its credibility," he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate with which to offer football.
"Nobody can doubt in Plzen this year he did a superb job."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what has been started by Hasek and make no significant change among people in the Committees."
"It did not wish to waste its success" said Rajchl which has assessed its rivals.

If a pool covered was pleased, she noted in her notebook without delay all details of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
Over 200 pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and presented them in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies of Bain." The municipal pools covered in Munich, the bath house in the historic black forest, "Hardcore" concrete buildings in the Taunus.
It conducted its "most exceptional trips to the baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited respectively Sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German of 46 years is a true devotee of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explained that it was not much of interest in sport but but feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that the supporters of swimming should simply look of blue tiles and cope with the stench of the bleach while the joggers breathe the spellbinding fragrance of spruce forests or can listen to gazouillement happy bird park.
"I requested a day why pools must in fact be always so ugly" said the Vienna.
"Therefore I started a collection of beautiful baths."
Surface water strengthens doubling the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oil, factor of well-being in the swimming areas are huge because all sense are awake, according to Meder.
And if builders would have given a little more of penalty, the rooms to swim could be a real delicacy for the eyes: "Instead of a floor was a surface water in the rooms of swimming."
"It is transparent on one side, but on the other hand, however, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically in a double way: vaults high, colorful tiles, platforms.
The volume of image of small format "Badefreuden" is a report of interest 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the historic oasis of well-being, it is certainly wish to make a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during its research in Hungary.
In addition of well-being splendid baths as the bath Széchenyi aged 100 years in Budapest, she found the water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst cave (bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths, pools are filled with water containing the alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building in a bottle.
However, outdoor heated pools of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a roof of the bath of Zurich was the entire town to its eyes, you can admire the Arlberg snowy from a pool of external St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which to observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design looks swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an OVNI just landing on the Alps.
In winter, steam rising from three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Smell of bleach is not of all pools of the collection Meder.
Many thermal baths from a smell of sulphur, the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba is a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin when you let slip in the pool, a spa experience special.
During its pursuit of beautiful pools, Iris Meder was also the subject of disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, it was found in a ground barricaded.
The bath designed by the architeque Du¨an Jurkovic in 1902 was now closed.
In casting a glance through the window of the immeuble-Art New in rouge-blanc-jaune, it noted the development of weeds between the tiles.
It observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of baths of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only of elements neo-romains leaving since its inception in 1844 but Moorish room in Alhambra style that has been added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization of 1995, the palace remains the favorite of the bath expert in thermal pool, Iris Meder, and not only because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It is already a fine performance that of melt construction if different styles in a unit so great," said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Speculation agricultural
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on the raw materials
In Christian Teevs
The German bank abandons its speculation on the raw materials?
According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has established a working group to explore the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group in order to draw the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a survey, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that the banks are speculating on the raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this Avenue business because it increases the problems of the poorest countries in the world.
It is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann stressed in this article that speculation Awards on the global commodities, pushing prices upwards and the banks share complicity to world hunger.
The consumer protection campaign aligns specifically against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share the opinion that the bettors have since posted offers and requests, and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "no case is worth jeopardizing the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information of SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently reviewing the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank results must be submitted, with recommendation, usually.
In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
It could result in a reduction of the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built its Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on the rising price of food shows in a draconian manner, to how the banks of today are detrimental to the public interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation. today
"Deutsche Bank should remove all of its investment portfolio, for which the money has been invested on the food speculation," said Bode.
"It is irrelevant, for Mr Ackermann, if it was a question of people hungry or if Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
The awareness of Ackermann may at first seem surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that the President of the Council of Administration will not change to what is provided for in the Council of Administration.
Ll could improve its image with a controversial abandonment of agricultural speculation.
And about potential losses, it has little concern to his successor, it will therefore deal with these.
A on two would terminate the investments on the raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode released the survey Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires to 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the price of food products are made.
Many clients of the bank would also personal consequences if they knew that their bank participating in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on the raw materials.
43 percent deconseilleraient of such a bank in their entourage, 49% responded that they would reflect the termination of their account to change "bank.
21st home in Vienna
The Pavilion which moved
On Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for the world exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
Now it is open to new and place of home exposure.
If there is enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, for his clear forms, its glass sheds, its bright, bold patterns and new construction materials that are typical of the belief in the technical progress, the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer was once the "Grand Prix Architecture" for its construction steel and glass, slight and suspended.
Construction is considered to our days as an important step in contemporary architecture.
It made the architects so famous, he has also built the following Austrian Pavilion for Expo.
With its legendary home to four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in form of bowl in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the Expo in the Garden Switzerland to the station south of Vienna, was transformed, and a museum of 20th century opened in 1962,
But the building was not physically or technically suitable for a museum, not of walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment.
However it was also long used, until "that contemporary art is a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and was increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now known as the "House of the 21st century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, which the house belongs, the first exhibition, a stroke of luck to any point of view.
The new departure was carried out by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new Director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian with a significant career between other in his youth of figure skater, subsequently in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, it has completed particularly the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, it received public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation.
Except contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation is the same name have been exposed, a cafe and a bookstore there, and a room must be built.
Monitoring strict, small budget
For achieving Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the flag was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exposures.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, who lost in generosity and light following his visit to Vienna and by a change of use.
During the current changes, there were major problems: the building was "a chasm in energy," said Krischanitz.
The profiles of facade windows were changed, of glass fiber glass insulation strengthened was asked and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and filled with asbestos coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made way for the new operation, a sign of subdued light between the house and the road lighting, provides a bridge leading to the entrance, is almost a new construction, but always the slight Pavilion Schwanzer.
Exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a color protection against rust red-brown color.
And the movie theater is exactly identical to what it once was.
And all under close supervision of authorities competent for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Materials that are often good and cheap should be found, and that appeal also to the Office of Protection monuments," said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a ground gross in basement.
Despite all the constraints, the issues and transformations, the "building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a story typical of "Drop-in-the-City."
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the conscience."
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck for urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the "Central Station" newly planned neighborhood, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may occur: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the support of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased the center of Berlin temporary art, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
Railway Society has developed a plan-crise, which aims to prevent the train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against the train accidents related to the winter season and the delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn "in this regard will spend more than 70 million this year.
The daily "Bild" -Zeitung reported in advance by invoking a plan-crise internal to the group, with a total investment of approximately EUR 300 million would be provided until 2015.
This should ensure greater availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees to remove snow from the railway facilities and docks should among other double and move to 16,000 persons.
The objective is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of track equipment necessary to service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Chief station Rüdiger Grube cautioned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents also this winter.
Last winter Railway society has had a lot of problems for the transport d "users, because it lacks one of reserves in case of severe weather conditions.
It is as many new regional trains were for years awaiting authorisation from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years of what to do, since it has to verify the axles of ICE trains more often to the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE at the main railway station in Cologne.
The German bank Deutsche Bank "pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the head Josef Ackermann case there's new to the US: the German bank Deutsche Bank "must pay a fine s" to the tune of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant of the sector up in addition to the US: the Institute of Frankfurt pay in comparison to $145 million (106 million euros) to settle a dispute because of the collapse of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is from the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to large banks a series of charges, and that of inducing the cooperative banks to make false promises concerning the purchase of financial products; they have minimized the risk.
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied, we could find a solution to this issue, and that the parties begin proceedings in court," said a representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank recognized in comparison no fault.
This is valid also for the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of an amount of $20.5 million.
President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks of the USA and intervenes in cases of bankruptcy, to protect the deposits of customers.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred to billions of dollars.
Comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks to party and in summer it has brought before the Court JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is of "Mortgage-backed Securities."
Credit houses are in the base.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, This was fatal for many banking companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events are already a few years old, at the present time it blows on the US banks a wind storm.
Investors and the supervisory authorities have brought many remedies for redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It complains that 18 major international banks, both the real estate financial d "US government Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to s" benefit in kind in cases of mortgages of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal to the FHFA, it is of several operations for a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request, that the Frankfurter answer the "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unjustified and said to defend themselves.
WARREN Buffett increases of 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the guru of the finance, IBM is investing huge sums in the IT business.
Since March, it bought the shares to a value of more than $10 billion.
Previously the large US investor Warren Buffett is not continually invest in IT technology companies, given that the "long-term evolution of societies do indicate that a poorer prognosis.
It has, however, read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector.
It had already realized much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as an attack of char in the world of finance.
Therefore IT activity IBM gives itself the right to call themselves to this "Mr IBM."
For Buffett revealed today at the "CNBC economic program, he purchased since March of IBM shares to a value of $10.7 billion.
Her investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never been anything of this commitment so far.
It congratulated the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits.
"You have done a super job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM set for some time on the lucrative IT services as "exploitation of centres accounting.
The pioneer of the computer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consultation that very powerful business computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided the technology companies.
He said he invests only in companies which it includes business.
But Buffett addresses instead the rail cargo, to manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries as well as of shares to a series of major groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 80-year-old of 81 years had taken in the 1960s "the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and the established in one of the most prestigious global companies, through smart investments.
However his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His meaning almost invariably to earn money earned him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha."
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment the IBM shares increased by one percent to the award.
"Big Blue," as is also appoints IBM, has a market value of a total of more than $220 billion, with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
For Microsoft, said Buffett, it does not want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" the Turkish media German have doubts about the rule of law.
A newspaper even speak of a "bloody" ideology, which renaitrait now.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this new, Turkey as well as the population German-Turkish reacts with fear and concern.
German-Turkish For much of the spectrum long thought dead rebuilt its appearance: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has not been a comparable with this context right-wing extremist violence against the Turks.
Let there be a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been discussed.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals the scale of the dimension is far from predictable.
"Is a return to the bloody ideology," "This was the title of the publication on the Internet of the Turkish daily" Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-homme of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned at the fact that the German authorities may be involved in the quagmire of extreme right.
It is in a reasoned manner that responded the Turkish community in Germany: it called this weekend in a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought about a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It is with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports of some Turkish media are the effect of a slap: "the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the platform turque- "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.
As the German publication of "Hürriyet" has no compunction to draw clear conditions.
"Begins to puer," This is the title of the chronic of Ahmet Külahci.
There points out that people have been murdered, have paid taxes and contributed by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The action of the police was seen very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they were subsequently discussed the success of their research.
 Why it has not already come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities to make research in some circles suspect right-wing, are surprised the authors.
More than one is ready for less drastic means or rhetoric: "If the case continues to be botched, it will remain the migrants nothing other than self-defence and the weapons."
"It will be the best self-defence."
"The inner peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," wrote "Selen."
What it means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained.
The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in memory German and Turkish.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to Turks living here that there is a real threat, and the Germans, on which the mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Once it is especially the failure of German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by its Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-turcs is local to the "rule of law since this date.
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is necessary this time.
The to bank scandal of Lake Zurich
The Bank the most adventurous of Europe is not in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.
UBS made almost failed in the financial crisis and patina in one crisis to another.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber s "was imagined.
After the dramatic departure of the head of the Bundesbank, was informed in July that he would be in 2013 a position almost as dramatic: President of the Council of Administration of the large Swiss bank UBS, a significant step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its strength recently obtained and made from kind remarks on the future colleagues.
"The UBS managed the Turnaround."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
Yet, from the month of September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A merchant of titles of UBS in London had diverted all security systems of the Bank and had flambé about 1.7 billion euros.
The Chief of the Board of Directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a banker well-known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is regarded since as with, and all are asking: When Axel Weber is finally?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
And it will resume the Executive Presidency already in May, not in 2013, as the bank reported Tuesday.
For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.
There is no banker, much more Professor d "economy and President of the bank, and he was certainly need an adjustment period.
Suddenly it assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has to prove once again that it has long since earned the title of "the largest bank to scandal in Europe."
Indeed, UBS is an enormous side, until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it patina for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, the savings if proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image the Swiss asset manager, silent and sound, but also shrewd, it had combined with the ambitious goals: it also wanted to become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed a side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
This made sense.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later Professor of bank for many years in Zurich said: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank to my students."
"In the current context, we wonder: how is it that I could simply I am wrong at this point?"
It is deeply wrong.
In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was not right to the UBS.
By mid-year President Peter Wuffli withdrew in surprising ways, which had hitherto been perceived as a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
Some months later it approached why he left.
The division of the bank had singed with sub-prime documents and had to cross on billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross above.
For this she actually found of investors, but shortly before, have fronce eyebrows: a state fund Asian non-transparent from Singapore and a bottom of Arab state, which was ignored, to the point that it has never even learned his name.
This n "was the first time.
In April 2008 it has worsened.
The bank was to announce new losses amounting to billions, the Governing Council chairman Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the highest-paid second board of Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought to the UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
Any Switzerland has been shaken, as she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country, to host such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 s "rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We could not save the UBS once again," said the researcher of banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster it is followed by the second.
Already a few months before, the UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with the United States and was ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who defrauded the tax possibly with the assistance of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million, for repayment of unjustified profits from those operations with a fine plus.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that she had helped the evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion.
After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Governing Council.
And of the exodus of clients' money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business lines: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of assistance to tax fraud.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as it did, that the UBS in would, it was to this unfortunate history of merchants of title: a single market of 1.7 billion euros as flared, before the bank was aware that something was not right.
And be published: with risk management in investment bank that still does not seem to function.
"With the case Adoboli, it was found that the control of risks to too little changed," said Martin Janssen, bank economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a major German bank was safe: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have the control of risks in hand."
However it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their function, that of become guardian of the vast wealth of the world: not too many risks, but security for money, and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of a strong reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a chocolate particularly noble.
The Central of the UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong image of the Swiss private bank, it is only slightly larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in the central station of Zurich, which led directly to the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, retail rents are among the highest in Europe.
The jewellers as Tiffany's, are found here between stores of Swiss traditions like those of the confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries of Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks as Julius Bär.
It is in the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, which are thick leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the bank, a major label for "safe."
UBS knows what the client research here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day away from the market, or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank found.
It would prefer not read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers it also does business with the two major banks.
UBS would become too large, trouve-t'il, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would be further spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And even though they have long been adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon which changed the investment bank UBS, has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS."
With up to about 68 billion francs, or EUR 45 billion, the politicians agreed to save from bankruptcy the large bank.
How could this happen?
If spoke with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group.
A bank was established, which was already too large for the little Switzerland, and has been constantly increasing.
What helped was that both banks predecesseuses different from the UBS completed: a rich, but lethargy with bank as strong point Asset Management in Zurich and a poor, but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the international investment banks were favourable access to lots of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel as a dream team," said the researcher from banks, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, that it is very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, which has found its way to the top with learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have used up "at the end to Wuffli.
And wuffli probably would have committed a critical mistake at the end: "He thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It is a tragic fall."
-- Perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
Staff of the UBS remembers clearly rallies of leaders during which the leader of the group Wuffli always gave the same watchword: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
It commissioned the "League tables" ratings, which have documented the success of banks at that time.
After all the UBS wanted to start at the top.
Some steps have already succeeded.

Crows smart spread in cities
In many places, the rooks are considered "problem bird." But the experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer hunt of cities for a long time.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are increasing due to dirt and noise of animals.
A antidote to the "° bird problem" is not yet in sight.
In the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts have said that this is no longer possible to hunt the rooks of cities.
The experts from across Germany deliberated on the possible solutions.
They seek alternatives in the cities
The protective of the problems of cities nature based also on the exodus of rooks particularly protected: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroy traditional vital areas.
Hunting, the development and logging of brooding typical made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under the protection of the nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 pairs breeding in the westfalischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had earned negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region.
Critics found the bird trapping in traps and their particularly brutal killing with clubs.
Normal "Expulsion, the ousted, serves no purpose," said the planner and landscape of the city of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using water pressure or cut down trees, often produces unintended consequences, said the environment expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals is away, the large colonies are and they disperse in other places."
L "ousting is conceivable only in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are obliged to live with them, we cannot kill them."
The problem is not solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Concevable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a packaging aversif and eye-catching offers, so as to enable them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospectait "of info panels in place of completely different chainsaws" to establish relations with: "We finally can better withstand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing on the lives of these highly intelligent rooks.
This project has since been adopted by the tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "This is a large number of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: The rooks use not only of working tools to reach a treat but they manufacture their own tools as instruments of work.
The éthologistes at Cambridge University tested four rooks recently, how is the intelligence of the birds.
In experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to be down scaffolding with stones to arrive at a larva.
Without a lot of training, they recognized determinement that a stone had some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, clever crows had to solve a problem more stocky.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not achieve their booty with their bill.
However, the researchers had set pieces of wire to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the assistance which they fished the small bucket of small pipe.
Three of the four rooks are even managed from the beginning.

The slaughter of mass staff
The new book by Peter Englund depth and generosity. Entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that you greenhouse the heart.
A Board to begin: tear up carefully this page and make your marque-page. parking
You'll learn about these people in detail. In this story novels of Peter Englund, the list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments where, as one of its men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war.
Swedish Peter Englund is a historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize for literature.
It wrote a book here outside the common he described, accurately, as "a book of anti-histoire."
There are few known names, the major treaties or of famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on the strategies and the equipment.
This is not so much a book about what happened, he says, that "a book describing to what looked like." They include "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The Beauty and the Sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of more or less ordinary, 20 men and women on both sides of the war, of young schoolgirls and botanists to escaladeurs, through doctors, ambulance drivers and vendors.
Some become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose of members, will become insane or lose life.
Their lives wavering here as the candles of a church: while some off, it renewed conflict of new.
The book by Peter Englund departs from the traditional history books.
It is a lie to the idea that the First World War is not by the terrible war in the trenches on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and the Sorrow" ably described other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and the East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are in hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war took the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina which reeks of the cordite.
When of cannon shots heard in the distance, and you're a stay-at-home mom, you stay or evade you?
Who will anyway?
Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
Peter Englund, "the lack of facts was expanded by assumptions, of the hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, of dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and the Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas fleet.
Their stories are derived mainly from briefs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details isolated.
Most address the deprivation and the ability to get.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, around ersatz."
"Coffee replacement, forged aluminum, rubber imitation wood paper, bandages, buttons."
It continues on alternative food in Germany.
It describes 'meat made of cooked rice crashed in the fat of sheep (and finished with a faux wood bones); manufactured tobacco with roots dry skin and dried potato; wooden shoe soles."
It asserts that "authorized 837 alternative meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 cafes alternative."
Some stories address the honor and courage.
An American recognizes its own drive to the savagery and said about the war: "You feel that after all, that is what the men were intended, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky to the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than argue that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your formal shirt and cloutee.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no person or the note will pay attention.
"When is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience," he wrote.
It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret."
Other comments related to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between the plants."
It takes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the broad mass of the beginning of the century: the murderer well-articulated and convinced ideologically, clothing well cut, which performs its beef while seated behind a desk."
People act of unexpectedly; there are so many basic behavior that heroism.
Peter Englund spoke of soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes to avoid the service at the front.
"Are the most grotesque in expression of trade was due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and s" range on the genitals in the hope of end to the hospital, "he wrote.
"The more desperate to apply on the eyes, which translates into a blind for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to the task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has "triggered the uncontrollable forces exclusively: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People begin to wonder why their leaders a war.
The best literature on the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) of Paul Fussel, or "A western nothing new," Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive.
The work of Peter Englund is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I read in a work non-fictionnelle.
I will reveal not to do the.
But it is as if it had emerged from his book, seized of your hands this page containing the list of persons and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some with riot helmets.

The operation remained secret from all but a few senior officers as well as other informed from the beginning that they would make in a year.
The Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, its presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be a repetition d "episodes in recent weeks, as the use of pepper spray against demonstrators, which went against the rules of the department and have created a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park of the demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police s "were prepared in observing the conduct of business in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the "island of Randall, in view of the operation in Zuccotti Park.
Police Officers receive better training against the riots, of counter-terrorism measures that include a large number of police to move quickly, to focus on the area of Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to travel in the park are managed "at the last minute," said a used, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"The few officers I know and were called did not know they would go in Zuccotti Park," said the person who anonymously.
"The only that they make are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city has retained a lesson, to where the secrecy of the operation.
On 14 October, the police wanted to clean the park but were made against hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Operation of Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces of the whole neighborhood, dozens of officers accustomed to neighborhoods particularly criminals.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were and were in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. An hour of the morning was a favourable time.
"It should take place when the park had the least of people" he said.
Emergency Services vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, to intervene.
The lights and resounding recorded messages of speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While in community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue jackets, many demonstrators have simply collected their business and are parties.
No attempts were affected before 1h45 said the police, which left the occupants time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of police were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were necessary.
Journalists present within the park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that the action had been taken solely by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would be unable to monitor the response within the park, roughly selected by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture the images.
While Police moved west through the thick jumble of cases of demonstrators, including the baggage of leaves, grass and plastic bags filled with clothing, teams from the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people located at the epicentre of the camp are hooked together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, "said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the lock.
No arrests took place in the park before three-thirty Kelly said.
According to the Police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "violating public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the highest-ranking officer to s "be found on the site.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department of detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although this, "does not lead the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police patientaient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention.
Barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
It saw the Police broaden the perimeter beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing from people.
Almost 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most serious of the night took place south of the park.
Towards 5.00 AM, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the top of a police car. Others were seen in the process to clear the tires of a police truck.
At a time, a piece of plywood has arisen in driving the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of school aid continues the city for redundancies
The union that represents hundreds of school aid who lost their jobs last month plans to institute Wednesday a lawsuit against the city for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissal. The impact is disproportionate on schools for disadvantaged students.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, to try to overturn the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, part of the city paid less, have lost their employment on 7 October last. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political revenge for not leaving the city access to a health care fund led by groups of workers, and which would have made it possible to close the budget gap last spring.
Municipal authorities categorically denied the accusation.
At a hearing of the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget ended in June.
A member Council responded, indicating that the layoffs of school aid n "were not specified in the budget.
Officers of the 37th District Council said that they would notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be continued; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the department of the Education of the city will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight laid-off women workers, all of them black or of Latin American origin, as most of the school aid who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the municipality has not been able to see the reasons of the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union will build on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest areas of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most regular aid due to under-funding.
While there are no dismissal on Staten Island, and some barely in the institutions of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of southern neighborhoods of the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employees at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of children live in poverty, the prosecution claim that "This is not a neighborhood of affluent parents who can bring in money to bridge the budget gap."
The budget of the "Public School 36 was reduced to 3.26 percent this year. Funds were also lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each entry (" disadvantaged student.
The union also claims that managers of schools have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The memo employed the term "overtaking" to describe the action, even though "overtaking" described more generally the action of moving a teacher in a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents have been laid off, and" not only because of exceedance ".
Mission completed: the Congress reach an agreement on the issue of Libya
It seems finally that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and the death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman, Independent, Connecticut, applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honor the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be innocent but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, legislators of both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
Bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margins and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the draft law, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce funding for US operations in Libya.
US mission therefore remained in a form of purgatory, the legislative Congress upset enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under the feet.
The indecisiveness of the Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The mission of NATO officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee's resolution "congratulates the Libyan people for his extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "commends the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and great professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Does new will enjoy the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate or divide as legislators in June?
Senator and Chairman of the Board Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version.
His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to require a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in the Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been submitted to the Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring, the same draft law proposed in both the House and the Senate, and others are of slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 in the House only versions of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support, including the new Republicans who want to gild their CVs, the chance of boast to be the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) approved in August asked the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators have voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat, New York) to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is constantly proposed, as the amendment banning desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposed.
As eager as were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
In the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slows compared with the early 1990s, when the members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate.
But these amendments had not much more success than they have today.
The last amendment to have been added, the 27th, was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords television in his first interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat (Arizona) emerged Monday evening in a television broadcast, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" Broadway and said they want to restore rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance in the news "20/20" on the ABC television channel, with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
L "show has touched his return difficult following the ball that has fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and described her recovery as "difficult."
After that Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years, responded "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was held at a special one-hour edition of "20/20," issued on the eve of the release of the couple's new book "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
L "special program traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting incident on 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, being seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on the front.
It is to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
Some months later, Gabrielle Giffords is seated in a wheelchair while the doctors to learn to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to seek to change the menu of his breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: is the Representative in singing with physicians air of Cyndi Lauper Girls "Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"? ".
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, it was currently to read an article on the shooting of 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed during the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and strongly treaty pending the trial.
There has been a lot of deaths, "said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During his recovery, "said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, said," I was beaten."
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you have not been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You have just been massacred.
And you're out, you restore and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala to Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans of the city of New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, the frustration and the loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-cravate has been standing on its feet for the cheering.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of funds spring.
A haut-grade military present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the United States, saw the role of troops in different ways.
"They were presented as a kind of orphan," the military haut-grade wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it "was not the respect. Just of compassion.
Impressions absolutely contradictory illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the military and an American public passionate but often distant.
Praise are provided to troops for their sacrifice.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public increasingly acts as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan.
"But it would appear that the only way to support us or we lock in the role of hapless minds."
It is a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, who do not wish to seem not grateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of returners troops of the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about the pity are held in confidence among the veterans.
After the return of its two sons of combat with the Marines, the retired colonel Mark Cancian has warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would watch with respect because they have been faced with insurgents and traveled to remote locations.
Other will consider if a veteran "angry and violent lurks under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work the Government in Washington.
When looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who had passed the interviews for subtle way it would be able to cope with the stress of a job requiring to Washington immediately after his return from combat.
"When you raise the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," said Colonel Cancian when he spoke to his son.
The military difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to the wars.
The victories are rarely pleased by a country also unfamiliar with the army and who sees little direct benefits of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same manner as for the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people focus heavily on the depth of suffering of a military.
Troops are recognized for the number of endured periods of service, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army face increasing pressure to punish rapists
Capital this week, a hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The soldier of 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was aged 25 years and pregnant for 11 weeks the night she was raped by a soldier.
C "was in October 2008 and returned to its barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a fellow carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"C" was a warning signal, "said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has set aside its concern.
I thought: no, it has 19 years.
"It is Texas," she says.
"I had to follow my intuition."
Few minutes after entering the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind, thrown by land and raped, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others not, wait with anxiety the decision of Justice at a landmark trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
These are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Located in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial involved initially 17 Complainants. This number amounted to 28 the following month, 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted and justice provided adjusted after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke said attacking military galonnees, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people in position" eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
Counsel also submits that since the month of February, it was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecution.
His strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants in this case, putting all its eggs in the same basket, it will initiate several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to 1950 a decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff in active service.
Claimed "The evil is inherent in the military service of complainants" indicate the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to make any comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women have still not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction is included only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are seldom all-male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, including to come into contact with local women.
Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives, two thirds in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize says Susan Burke.
It is not alone in this fight: three other trials are ongoing in most of its own.
A l "Yale Law School, the center of legal services veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" awarded to victims of rape to give leave-a relatively regular, according to the activists as Anu Bhagwaru the Service Women's Action Network (military), a group for human rights.
His group filed a lawsuit in December to the Veterans Administration, by accusing them of discriminatory practices in the treatment of requests for benefits for persons who have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine draft law independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing different solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded from the center of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this represents approximately 13.5% of 19,000 incidents this year.
The report released in March also studies the percentage of legal proceedings: in 2010, 20 percent of registered cases in the army have been the subject of a trial, half the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
The complainants in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first in a series of injuries.
In the case of Lyman, it informed the military police of rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, asked about 11 times in detail his rape to different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the assailant's blood, due to a cut to his arm, was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is seated before a judge, in a trial in which the questions on sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was delivered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to begin to have contractions. I started yelling at the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer" This was not a trial but the mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, which eventually diagnosing a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under the terms less than honorable, preventing him from receiving benefit.
Does the case Lyman and other complainants argue or not, it is a long story, said John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by the responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important they are trying," he said.
These change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, counsel for the complainants, with its hundreds of other complainants to other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as there will be no reform" she said.
Where up "to what we were, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers you are on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy making its anti-immigration views online.
Monday, Breivik, who has admitted having been taken to a murderous folly in Norway in July allowing 77 victims, was facing its first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy. Connect you on Facebook.
"We realized that" it was not that difficult to find them, "said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report by the Reflection Group of DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of such personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they need with scientific precision, the way marketers have been doing it for years.
L "team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It has targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, advertisements invited users to complete a survey. The questions were related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
In coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to examine 10,000 followers of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries, without leaving the office.
"It is a new way of doing research," said Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those that combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
L "study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.
Focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to consider all issues affecting health issues as social trends, with "I love," published on the walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users who add three contained on average per day, the data "supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research site whose name appears in the title of almost 800 percent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study of people that you may not be in the streets.
"Before, when you try to conduct investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify."
"You had to go to the party, but you were never allowed to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoided this, you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and to address the health and social problems.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploits intoxicated were significantly more likely to be alcoholic that students quiet about.
Megan Moreno suggested that colleagues of the students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and possibly intervene to help a student whose status speak too often alcohol.
"You cannot address a problem if you do not," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of the diagnosed Megan Moreno and Director of the Centre for health, behavior and development of children at the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and in another case that would not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly access to information of its users.
L "team of the site which is considered the statistical data concerning the situation of love and the day of Saint Valentine, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to digital information available, only the champions of freedom have for long argued that the site could make its wealth of data available to others for research purposes).
But of Facebook users know that the site notes, that they like or not, in exchange to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, the site is authorized to have access to your information.
But what happens when the users of Facebook are part of a survey that they had not even heard?
While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information otherwise than through the Internet, it is anything else online.
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a study of 2006 it conducted in observing the Facebook walls of its students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to determine the extent of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
Facebook 'What you say and what you do in reality are two completely different things, "says Neil Selwyn.
This is why, despite its technological experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with the people," he says.
"Social studies are intended to address the social aspect, and the social, it is not to a computer."
"Refrigeration and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" in his first appearance at the trial which takes place in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and of the Temple of Norway," he said in a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, I reject, because you keep your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue because it "did not want to give him the opportunity to use the trial to express their views."
For the same reason, it refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim has also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody 12 more weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
A 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of watching Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I n" was not comfortable, but I personally am a little advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eye in entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a broad movement of "resistance," the judge determined that he was not crazy. It also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The of 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which perhaps will cheer him in some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I preferred that it resembles a monster, but this is not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 from the interview lost to Steve Jobs, the film this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October last, some have compared to Henry Ford, characterised by the engineering and inventor of the modern computer.
But what fans of Apple may find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs found recently and which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative spirit had understood the process and work flow of products.
It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. It is identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a breeder of charts, a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from a "disease their suggesting that a great idea is 90% of the work... (but) a considerable amount of manual work between a great idea for a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series traces the birth of the computer, and it sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and unusual conversation.
At this time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. It was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a People's adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in the transport.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage of the director.
This video, slightly rebound, is the film of 68 minutes, "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone of known to hate the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs appears surprisingly enthusiastic here to provide technological philosophies and its business strategies.
And incredibly close.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the issues, between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs is clearly its thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There were also times when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where it seems eager to hear the issues of Cringely, giving the shots to contend for the accelerate and move to issues or issues of utmost importance.
Shot before the "era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other businesses and is part of its own vision on the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of gross and lines on the rights that we see here, the dreamer anxiety on the eve of the magnitude.
It has a vision on how things can be and should be.
It is then put on using them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequence of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: Why do you do things?" and the answers are always the same: 'oh, simply because we need them."
No one knows why, no one thought in depth to things in a company.
This is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues providing details on its efforts to simplify the accounting for Apple.
Perplexed on how the costs were registered, it is often by a "standard" valued at cost to nose, then adjusted with a "variation" -- he has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the accurate calculation of trade costs.
On the opportunity to play a round to Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak, a device that was used to hack the phone networks and call free in long-range.
The device has been the subject of many written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in its description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, through an appeal and by connecting to a network AT&T satellite to another while avoiding as much as possible.
"We enveloppions the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and you arrived a minute later to the adjoining public telephone," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and through the Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves able to control billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."
We both know little, but we have created a small thing able to control things. This was an incredible lesson, and I don't think one day that Apple would have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go on laughter just before the Pope himself is woken up.
On his love with technology (canvassing and Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, to hunting for spare parts to manufacture a frequencemetre, it seeks the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and to pass a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs is a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a remarkable impact on me. C" was the only company that I'd seen to that age and it brought my definition of a business and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs subsequently became one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever conceived."
It was as large as a suitcase, had a small tubes. I have fallen in love.
Adolescents that j "was returned with HP and began to write programs for the machine.
On improvisation of innovation:
A several times in the interview, Steve Jobs spoke to invent new products on a whim.
Early in his career, when he moved to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a complete computer.
Working to only 30 days of credit, he had to deal with the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, in Apple, he remembers the difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... I am shouting above by claiming that it will take five years (to make a mouse that cost $300). I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could manufacture for $15 and which was incredibly reliable.
Of the large companies that are faltering:
Long before it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would fail and lose control of their market share.
"If you worked for IBM and Xerox, you better copier and printer, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the company did not meet more than success.
Sales and marketing can evolve, therefore (these are the types of people) that will eventually run the companies and personnel specialized in product are set to the "gap of decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly is completely rotten by those who cannot imagine design a good product from a bad product, the manual work required.
It is what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could hold the whole computer industry.
It could make 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s.
They uprooted the defeat to the victory.
On innovation as art form:
"A huge amount of manual work between a great idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it is changing and growing."
You learn a lot on its intricacies.
There are tradeoffs. Some things you cannot do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the plants also.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling to each other.
Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste. It is to try to present the best products that men have created, and to try to make these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists copy, great artists steal.
We always ashamed of fly of excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes exceptional Macintosh. The people working on it were musicians, poets, the zoologists, historians, who have simply been the best computer scientists in the world.
If there is for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas provided with lunch opponents of the health law while the court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the question of political discord, namely if the opposition to President Obama's law of health will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noted at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.
One of these cases involved a lawsuit by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by the Congress last year, legislation that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument of 5 1/2 is due in March, and the result is likely to be conducive to the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be growing at the time of the court's decision will be made.
Counsel to be held before the court and argumentera on the rejection of the law, is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. solicitor general during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Society Fédéraliste (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another proponent was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
If included, among others, Mitch McConnell, Senate's top Republican and opponent said of the health law.
Guests the featured dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Society Fédéraliste for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may assist in fund-raising organizations linked to law and other although the judge cannot be a participant, a guest of honor, or on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas to close to two law firms in the case, as well as a massive enterprise with a financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court shall respect the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and were having dinner and a gala fundraising with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds for this event dismantle any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily the affairs of the Court with the agenda of groups such as the Society Fédéraliste.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist of haut-profil.
Furthermore, the Conservatives argue that it is the Justice Elena Kagan has a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Solicitor General of the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were raised in the court of first instance.
His critics have lobbied for Kagan withdraws to hear the case, saying it was too invested in defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that it would do so.
Boeing has a control record $18 billion for aircraft line
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 aircraft of bi-couloirs line, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary in what a company receives an order looking 50 of its products.
This is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and that the amount of these 50 had reached an all-time high of $18 billion.
Equally incredible is that Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders for aircraft.
In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will be needed in the next 20 years of 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history, 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this pharaonic control.
Boeing announced the Aerospace Show in Dubai in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order of $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model which boasts significant fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft s "amounts to more than $1 billion.
"It is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar analyst.
"These clients in particular have a immense value."
In Middle East, oil producing countries have many of their airlines.
They not only the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise of fuel prices, usually harmful to airlines because it is their most important costs-would not if harmful since the country needs money with the rise of oil prices.
This is an important point because these are less likely than other companies to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the price of oil increases, reported Dihora.
"They coverage of natural risk," he said.
The control of Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing in the market for wide-body aircraft and helping to stop the attempt of encroachment by the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes its inception to increase the growth continued at the request of its clients to increase its carrying capacity and autonomy.
Actions of the Boeing Company increased by 1.5% to reach the $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister clearly beaten the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the gubernatorial race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its attempt to access functions of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of its opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for the post of Governor of the State of the West.
"The response of organized crime throughout the voting process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon to radio in an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, electoral officials... They have seized ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and forced the people to vote for the PRI."
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until "to lose the presidency in 2000.
But it organizes its return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to be demarcated little of Calderon, who was leading in opinion polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, the candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognize Vallejo as winner.
Silvano Aureoles, leftist candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently occupies the post of Governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential for this left divided and unhappy.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the "State, denied any link with drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels engaged in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is of the "State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was murdered as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections have air, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man expected to be the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo in Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
The LADS urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has applied to India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers in the world's most rapid growth should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or of direct bilateral agreements.
It has discouraged the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe a "indifferent eye" and noted that Asian financial support with the leaders and resources of Europe would "avoid a collapse of the global economy long-term.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected until" at some point but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, that nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian debt is dangerously skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has spurred the fear that the world economy is not in recession, and has been the call of the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area to find a solution.
Mr. Nag has it appeared it might turn out that the IMF would provide any assistance Asian, but also stated that such bilateral assistance, such as buying bonds of US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, provided greater power in negotiations with Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area since its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of arrivals of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the euro area remains unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have enormous challenges ahead and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find the work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich European when they face their own economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept assistance to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow," he said.
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the reserves of India should be used to maintain many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause "significant impact" across Asia.
Forecasts of the BASD of economic growth of 7.5 percent in 2011/12 Asia now face "risk of loss" because of the European threat.
He noted that emerging markets vulnerable needed "develop" contingency plans "to protect itself from an economic downturn and significant capital flight.
Sévères Pentagon warnings on the potential reduction of defense
Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on the Congress Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It has triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, through crowds of civilians.
The Pentagon digests already $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now feared that an additional amount of $600 or more of cuts is imminent if the Congress fails to reach agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
It stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is known as sequestration, would be 23% of reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"A reduction also important, applied and indiscriminate, would make most of our vessels and of our construction projects unenforceable, you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or vessel, and serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians to leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
Continued The reductions would ultimately affect the fighting troops, Panetta.
"Although the funding in time of war contingency accounts abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the disruptions in the core budgets," warned Panetta.
"The Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract that support the war."
"The staff managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as undisputed world leader of the military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this drastic action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta.
"This is not a result with which we can live, and this is certainly not that we should impose."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
What Panetta's letter and the recent warnings of senators will increase the pressure for a compromise budget or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent on possible cuts, even if it is reached itself at the highest position of the Pentagon with years of expertise budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense has painted a grim picture of what could happen, a military with a shell, but no core.
"It is a ship without marine."
"It is a squad without bullets."
"It is a fighter, without enough trained pilots."
It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs, which do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission, "Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force depressed, unprepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries."
"De facto, it invites to the aggression."
In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta stated specifically how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: reaction time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed future in combat operations."
And Panetta stated that some of the largest defense projects could the axe, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new bomber planned, the new-generation ballistic missile submarine, the new warship coastline and the new ground, which would replace the Humvee vehicle of the army and navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step to improvement and to respond to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How identify a lie
A look at recent headlines indicate to what extent the deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The Republican candidate to the presidency Herman Cain is engaged in exchange of allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The Penn State administrators were accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports of a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying the US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulse of countries.
The member of Congress from New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, is past for a fool by issuing denials quickly contradicted by evidence irrefutable.
The former presidential candidate to the John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign financing related to coverage of an extramarital affair.
And, none of that has lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying in his second term on ​​son sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating in tests of the school and university are legion.
There have been cases where the teachers gave the test answers to students to be clear on their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deception have we?
On a given day, the studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are lies piles.
Another study showed that foreigners are deceiving three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being similar to, say, a board game of charades, where the objective is to describe himself: "I had you," the detection of serious deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted an extensive search of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that older myths on the lies were demystifies.
The liars look at you in the eye.
They do begayent, feeling or is not always in.
Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, training of the question and the response time.
I spent several years to consider scientific results in the wide body and still emerge from the knowledge on deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern jurisdiction that is easy to learn and use to navigate our complex world, especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or management.
The good liars are entitled to read the other, making them comfortable, in managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that the outgoing lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more than lies "focused on the other," usually to protect the feelings of someone, that married people lie less frequently to their partners and unmarried persons (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a mecreant, the other will feel less guilty when you lie.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
Firstly, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is the so-called "establish the benchmarks."
This helps to provide a baseline for measuring future changes.
Observe the position of your subject, laughter, the voice quality.
You should know if someone wags normally its feet at all times to not make unjust accusations when you see stir up the feet in the middle of the meeting.
May look for signs of misleading verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these indices such as red flags, not evidence of deception.
People misleading can stop the upper body when trying to remember their history, they can target their feet toward the door, look to an exit, significantly change of posture or submit a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult issues are past.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the maintenance is done just to seek to initiate the post-interview reaction.
Therefore, beware the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson has derailed by using the past while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search for the find.
Misleading Individuals can also use a language left behind: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman. Ms. Lewinsky" fully or repeating a difficult issue.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone may use many "langue de bois" in its answer to a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scam artists to operate their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval of United States
A few days after the Obama administration had threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, provoking the anger of unions while appeasing environmentalists, the company seeking to build the pipeline said she is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill of Nebraska.
The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to a federal license for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of sand dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water sources.
"It is a real way forward," said Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and it expressed its support.
The 2.735 km oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, it should be cross six States.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have focused on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan are pressure that legislation to force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study in the Department of State found that the project would be only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a child to vomit for fear
A family of New York claims that the Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched in a rampage in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, has terrified the girl to the point where she vomited of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" has scared the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, to the point that it has been "changes in personality, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of foreigners," said his family during the trial of the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on 10 November last year while the stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève preparing to travel as a family.
While Kevin Monk would pick up the car, Roseanna Monk down in the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their baggage, Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said that it had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a time.
"Someone came behind me and said: 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said 'yes' and I went to pick her up, "she says.
LaBelle angrily chastised the pregnant woman.
She told me of an aggressive tone: "You should not let your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I replied:" I am not interested in what you say or think."
It became rabid and began to use of language, the word "and" with a strong voice.
It had a bottle of water and began spraying me of the bottle of water.
It stated that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I said to the woman:" Look what you did to my daughter, "said the mother of the child.
LaBelle jumped on the mother, who was always Geneviève in his arms, and had to be taken by her friends, who brought him to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk.
The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
Counsel and the representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comment.
The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family planned to donate any money received to a cancer charity for children.
"The goal is to take Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, particularly to a kindergarten teacher with a child aged 18 months."
The adversity climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of management Mario Lopez Valdez, to Sinaloa unemployment and the informality increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy shrank
2011 is a year which would be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, auto-appele of change, which has generated great expectations in regard to the advances of the economy, but given adversity climate at the beginning of the year, the increase is not, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures from February, from causing loss of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the ability of the state's economy to growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the frozen allotments by the report issued by the Mexican Council Rural Development Soutenable, there has been some damage of 582 million 835 hectares, with a total 78.03 percent have suffered damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chick peas.
The drop in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate in the State during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rapid increase, because during the January to March 55,000,053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of Active Population Economics, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to increase until 6.19 percent, a rate that is more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18,000,969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly in terms of the actions carried out by public policy.
"What is an increase in unemployment is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in the Congress to combat money laundering, because the people who earn US$ the in an illicit manner, it is not easy work to earn them, they invest and use them in something," he said.
Migration held
López Cervantes said that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people are here and are sources of work, with the result that unemployment increase," he said.
Lack of serious
The analysis of labor market sinaloen worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to INEGI, the 60.38 percent of the employed population in this state is working without pay as workers in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of serious lag, another reason for the state are the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of workers sinaloens was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the drop in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 has been the largest reduction of Overseas Direct Investment of the past 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the FDI in the State has reached 630 thousand $697, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to 143 thousand 312 5 million registered in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State recorded a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos recorded per year, mainly by the tertiary sector companies.
The debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the requested State in July to Congress public approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim of reactivating the economy, congressional approval of the State was to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November we found no benefit of the debt in any sector of the economy of the State.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there is no harmonisation of the minds of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The economy of Sinaloa's performance during this year has been really very poor, it must work hard to recover the ground we have lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, it was necessary to align the efforts of everyone, especially the course already synchronized to the new team of Government, hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Slow economic
Loredo López said that events such as frozen at the beginning of the year have used the state's economy and have restricted its performance and growth.
"Low fluxe economic is product of several events, among which jellies, one of the major effects was a slow economy that is fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level (e flows in the trial, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations that we had," he said.
Redefine the role
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic Patronale of Sinaloa said that it wants to channel the State towards productive activities more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program which redefined the role and the economic direction of the State, because it is important to detonate the full potential of human and material resources of Sinaloa," he said.
Many to make
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a better vision of future which focuses the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in how management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much work has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kilograms of marihuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marihuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the small trafficker sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crimes against health, in its alternative of possession of marijuana for sale.
Pursuant to file PA/NIS/SLB/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in the street Cipriano Valdez, before the number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.

For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre of Implementation of Legal Consequences of offences.
Debts to the contributions to the literature
The works of social envisaged in programs such as Coalition, Rescate of Spaces Públicos 3 x 1 and para migrant may not be finished with record of serious delays due to lack of economic resources, "said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that even if the construction programs have progressed so far, they are in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State is not acquitted of its obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the State must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe provided resources for the books, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have nothing, even though since July they should give us a party," he said, "and we, to register no delays, we started the works and we have come a long way, but we need the money."
He noted that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid their contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to seek a credit to cover the $7 million that the administration of the State had not provided at this session.
"We had this in the previous six-year period because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year we, to have access to these programs, we duu obtain the resources to cover that the State had not paid," he detailla.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the authorities of the State to provide these resources, he said they had made the asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management for the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us."
The Court valid "analog cut-off" in Mexico by 2015
The replacement of analog by digital signales exchange is one of the most important that the world has suffered the last years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the House of Deputies made against the presidential decree which advance the so-called analog cut-off from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded its authority when it issued the decree outlining the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this outcome, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionalite Decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, developed by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, suggested the statement of the decree as non-constitutionnel, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In for the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and assuming the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the Order and all actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers resolved also dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In its intervention, the Minister President said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Government cannot structure through general measures for standards that public administration is preparing.
"I do not believe that if he did it would affect the independence of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Government, which has a constitutional mandate the leadership of the State.
The replacement of analog by digital signales signales is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last few years and this is reflected in better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of signal and more channels.
Ajourner the change, he argued, would postpone the benefits of digitisation which implies a public policy decision that not only has a technical dimension, "since it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "require the operation of a system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the ability of the Executive of the State."
It recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world have already finished the digital transition and they did it through the Commission, despite the fact that they had the very specialized technical bodies.
It cannot conclude that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it provides in the administrative sphere compliance with laws issued by the Législative, he assured.
It analyses the possibility of a statement "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According the data highlighted by PERs, the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor is to only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where the data identified by the Program Results Électoraux Preliminary Notices (PERs) the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor is to only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past November 9, the electoral body approved a set of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal reform in electoral matters.
It is recalled that Michoacán has not approved or its Political Constitution and the Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Act of Justice, in conjunction with the Congress of State approved the reforms shortly before that end the legal time limit for election that this trial can enter into force and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication within the deadlines specified by the Act of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that it had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Authority Législative and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state for the constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to "sanction or challenge."
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote," María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that through the approval of the guidelines by the General Council of EMP it will be possible to achieve the total and partial counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of electoral votes, of one or more packages, it may be that the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the file of the ballot box is not in the president of that company; or there are errors or obvious alterations of minutes.
Moreover, the total number of votes received in all polls of the election can be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the presumed winner of the election and the candidate who won the second place in the election is equal or by less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session is a petition by the representative of the party or coalition that has presented the second of candidates reported.
The total count of the vote may also be achieved if at the end the common statement it is assumed that the difference between the candidate and the second place winner is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is a petition by the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case we will exclude the electoral packets that were subject of the partial count.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where the PERs, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 minutes total.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis which brought the country to the brink of economic disaster
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis which put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire Eurozone.
A release of the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
It expects to present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he would submit to the President the outcome of its talks with the political parties in his essay to form a government.
"I wish to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti has not said explicitly that it could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"Framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a time shorter than normal, while Italy fighting a political and financial crisis that pushed the cost of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy who had been affected.
In stressing the pressure on Monti to dispatch, the volatility of markets to put the yield on 10-year Italian BTP bonds over the 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved.
Business Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We have said that we would support much this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy kind of this emergency situation.
Success of Monti's opportunities have been greatly encouraged by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis has forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of LDP, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members were opposed to the Government of majority technocrat that Monti form.
Parliamentary Support
Monti's new government must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack of financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure to Monti noting that bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and youth and women's organizations.
It will complete its tour of meetings Tuesday at night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed a rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that the Government should continue to future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions of the fact that politicians will only the time to implement the reforms prior to the elections forward.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources noted that the mutual suspicions and disagreements between the parties are the test include political figures.
Experience of Spanish is higher than that of the Costa Rican
Of 22 footballers called of Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
In the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 meetings.
A enormous contrast to that of Costa Rica, comparing the 22 summoned by the two countries for the friendly today to 15:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national champions of Europe, and the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, recorded a comprehensive register of games inter-selectionnes of Class A, the Tricolore only has the defender Michael Umana as the only to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and in the powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, keep under an intense activities in national league and Cup championships and disputes in European cups and the Champions League.
To this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola complicated during the playoffs of the European and the World Cup.
The Costa Rican football, on the contrary, have limited international experience to an area, as the Concacaf, which is considered to a lower level in FIFA.
We see record that the largest of the Spanish Selection is the goalie Íker Casillas, who earlier Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the former goalie Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, flying brain of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the center front of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Loan of figure centenary is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
In the Costa Rican share, and near Michael Umana are the left lateral Júnior Díaz, with 48 attendance and the scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After this, only five have exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa, Michael Barrantes with 31, with 32 Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those who have least. With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only had four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar was only a and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson begins again.
Historic The scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50, followed by Fernando Torres flies with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who has the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said that the group is prepared to provide one of the best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They waited more than 20 years, but the group said that for them it will be a dream come true to occur in this country.
It is the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, in speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, the last week.
The group is on the South American side's tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will be its sole stop in Central America.
This day will be on the National Stadium, from 19:30 p.m., next to the group of Los Angeles The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, which the full transcript is in La Nación on Internet.
Costa Rican For its followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will be in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality for us.
This is our second time in the South and Central America and so far this has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a beautiful country and I think that we will be able to spend a few days.
This émotionne therefore to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you to stay beside us for all these years.
There have been 21 years if we are to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting and we regret the fact that so much time had to go to the concert.
Some people say already that the concert is the largest show of the year.
Does it adds a bit of pressure to your visit.
Some of larger shows we provided during the last 21 years have taken place in the past two weeks.
We have offered a two enormous shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this put us in form for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very eager to produce it.
We love this country, we like to do of surfing and the jungle; for two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to make the surfing?
We have many friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends would always to make the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, alongside of Mexico, are great places to make the surfing; that is how we have learned, through the gents who like surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we have never products there, we have no restriction with regard to what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good repertoire and various.
You never repeat the directory.
What is it?
I think it is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 different songs and each love songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the inventory that we no longer have interpreted for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked the songs and we have forgotten.
This fact that the show is more interesting for us and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people.
With this tour, you are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
In looking back, it is difficult to believe everything you have been successful?
Yes, absolutely.
Firstly, I believe that none of us imagined that we would train a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years that it seems like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together we émotionne much.
We love and we love create music.
We are fortunate to go to parts of the world which we have always wanted to go.
The things could only get better for us.
What means for you is to have been a key element in the creation of the grunge?
This has always been an honor to be part of this group of major groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement emerged from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerged from a city, but it is much more odd when five or ten groups emerge at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the group of Seattle.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw to Soundgarden in their tour, so we are fortunate to be still friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to be part of this son of Seattle that has emerged.
It is also very strange that a group as your remains united and with the same members for a long time.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for the other.
We are all close friends and through is there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each test.
We have confidence in each other with music of each and it could only get better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity was not easy; however, through your success, you have to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We assure the fact that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of large multitudes and people who love your music.
If not to forget that the people are there for the music, we help not to forget the need to respect the music and what made, without getting in mind the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which is not really to any of us.
How do you remember of your project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote of good songs and early it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before of the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) which began in the group with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think to the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laughing, talking about football, music and many other things with him.
It was an amazing human being and we lack.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and why you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, production has sent videos with different proposals and that was the group that we liked the most, so we are keen to see what Las Robertas can offer online and it must be very distracting.
What change you always the words of Yello Ledbetter online?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It's who sang and I believe that it is with the first words that he imagines.
As bassist, what are its influences?
There are so many.
Among the first which I remember there are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon on the bassistes that I love.
How succeeded Pearl Jam has maintain under the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think, this reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if it is in now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
Early, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What should this change?
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs from the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as songs very obscure, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grandis and there is trauma in your life and you lose to a friend or relative, these things are starting to influence your art and your music and these songs, without doubt, is that for me.
I believe also that we can also be pleased and even as it can be to obscure music.
Peru:
Fujimori again hospitalized for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength that he introduced in the northern, informed his family physician.
Fujimori, 72 years, serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his 1990-2000 government suffers from various illnesses, enclosed a cancer of language for which it has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said on Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated during three days in the National Institute of Diseases Néoplasiques to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in his limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the penalty for humanitarian reasons, without doubt, he said that his or her wishes because he is innocent.
It was made four times for cancer of language, it has a weight loss of weight of 18 kilograms, and other diseases, such as severe gastritis contact, a cyst pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems of movement in the feet, said the doctor.
Fujimori is serving the imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations Police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people due to a squadron of annihilation of the army which has operated illegally during the first years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to strengthen political ties
A formal procession, with the head Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of various ministers and patterns, will on Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political authorities, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information in the political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to the local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France which took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the countries that the international community continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico since November chairs the G20, a group of emerging economies and developed stronger in the world, and had in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to send the realization of agreements to exchange tax out of the "gri list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Treaty Free Trade (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber moustachu passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario, tireless, fought for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will contend for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
Title, arriving this month to stores across the world, was designed from the outset to fully exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, enabling it to play in three dimensions without the use of glasses.
"Mario is the man who must say as must operate the stereo without glasses," said the head of press for Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game for Nintendo originally designed for this format," because so far the success as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" was of adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a video game "accessible" that allows some rapid and fluid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, most experts will be a "second round" to levels of game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose to real time between an aggressive "D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the person to a portable console, which is no longer required since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo made a nod to the followers of the saga and repeat the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the plumber moustachu must travel undermined platforms of perils for release to the Princess Peach.
Although I find developments in the player movements, the environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "possible."
Colom gives its consent to Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given an order for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to meet the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$ 70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala responds to the request of the north country for Portillo to try this.
In press conference, Colom said that its decision is based on the independence of the judiciary and executive taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his mandate "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and it had been to all extraditions that he had.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom made requires Executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former agent of the interval 2004-04.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and of the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving its legal situation in Guatemala and having secured its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the case prior to extradition, but the prosecution appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity is born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The review of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during the quarter of a century.
In addition the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by social group.
The anniversary was yesterday to take stock in a celebrated act in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove is born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people poorly trained, unemployed, with addiction problems or marginalized.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of responsible entities and institutions which in these 25 years worked with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of Regional Government Catalonia (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall and the current mayor and former Deputy Mayor Councillor éco-socialiste Ricard Goma.
Attended also Fabra i Coats in the Great Hall of the current Minister of Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that current is also, but it added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The Chair gave Trinijove as example to see combat poor circumstances and to give hope to the people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new to the entity and for the work that it is doing," he said.
Ownership invaded by squatters for micro-fetes, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate in 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, to Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of the No. 51 of Street Balmes had ended.
Twelve people have left at noon yesterday voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and they hold micro-fetes which desesperaient the neighbors, by court order and without need of a police intervention.
At the end of the operation were changed the lock on the door to avoid a repeat of the situation.
"From this day there will be access control," affirmat the administrator.
The squatters, who invaded 11 of 13 apartments of the building-the rest were inhabited, won the electrical installation and a portion of the water, from painting the walls and leaving any residue of any kind, especially of boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of celebrations of masses, which lasted until two days and desesperaient tenants.
In side of the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that as the occupation of the building his case dropped a 80%.
The owner of the discotheque referred to the invaders of the property was unfair of the jurisdiction, since they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the club they were worth 10.
Moreover, the owner of the local recreation had to respond to complaints from neighbors for noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and especially the participants organized celebrations there, which were more frequent and intense the last few weeks, as the angry neighbors of the area.
The responsible for the discotheque explained that the problems were so big that it has reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it is nine months that he "forgave" him rent.
La Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The President of municipal group CP of the mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had sought the last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to deal with the problems of living together and citizenship that it caused to residents and degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only a floor of the building was occupied, but the last month the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there are also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must put an end to impunity and be relentless against anti-social behavior generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos Catalan (local police) evacuated a building to Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to ¶ 35 of Street Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people had access to the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the desirability of convening beyond the controversy on the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the mid 1980s, in the height of the deja-eteinte Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), the Administration has printed signs of promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona.
Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become new, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that is not on the north-south axis, or high (mountain), low (Sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural environment park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with wild boar on the role of Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed by 16 competition for all gateways to Collserola.
A door shall provide to the idea of park, no doubt.
That is, or someone wants to put the doors in the field.
The question appears alone: Collserola: Park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization as regards the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme which two members of this ancient caste elected to speak when they recognize in an elevator.
This is one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who have presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the blocks of green was not conducted to end.
"It must start from the basis that the park more extended Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "gave the verdict the architect for which the" doors of Collserola "contains a" trap "lexicon: we must think to them" such as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas in which action is needed."
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "few perils."
New perils that are derived from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience in the 1980s and who was in the area of the Forum "its swan song."
The first fear is the own boundaries on which we can build.
"Limiting something means establishing already the next step," i.e., the excess.
"Consider to urban planning, new instruments, because current (in reference to Plan General Métropolitain (MGP) can cause of authentic disasters."
Keeping more to the issue, Modol felt that, by streamlining, the watershed of the El Valles region of Collserola "can be understood as a park, the Barcelona, not."
Modol said that there was already a work done by the Collserola Patronat which "must not be lost," in appreciation for the opportunity that the city offers corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment."
Furthermore, it means that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether the technical profile must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he says) that the creation: "We, the architects, should be only a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that is the title of this piece is complex, because of the foundations of the competition it lack a global vision of Collserola: "We called 16 cross-cutting competition, he says, in the sense montagne-mer, but there is not a longitudinal reading that way and understand the area as a whole."
This is, at least in this case, it has opted to participate in the 16 competition.
In a different way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the program and with the definition of the architect of the door.
In its opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately than Ronda of Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an equipment that makes a gentle transition zone between the city and the green.
Casino to forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days for provisional arrest, the legal proxy of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the proceedings initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the basis of the legal authority of the Casino Red grant the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, following a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of the Casino Red Gil, Sergio García, published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manual Jonás it required the payment of a quotte economic for the mayor of Monterrey will allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Department Public Agent 3 of Patrimoniaux offences, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the former Headquarters of the State capital.
There remained for the 49 days when it delivered a second order of detention after the officer of the Public Ministry has dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to penal center of Cadereyta allegedly for having sing with one and a half million pesos the owners of Casino Red, but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October harvest an order was issued by the Clerk of the Second Criminal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation confirmed there was evidence sufficient to determine the guilt of Jonás, like on the collection of 1.5 million pesos of representatives of the gambling house in exchange to allow its operation.
This Monday, the basis of the legal authority of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore it could recover its freedom in the next hours.
During the legal formalities, the officer of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the injury had been recovered and that members of the gambling house was that granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried to withhold the name.
Under the record 197/2011 the legal pardon has been granted to Jonás Larrazábal and later we will not make any claim on the trial against him; we asked no compensation for damage and no punishment.
After the hearing of based the statutory authority of the gambling house, at 3:50 p.m. we ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of municipe of San Nicolas de los Garza to communicate to Jonás legally and that he had been forgiven his file would be classified.
He will be the order of immediate freedom that the judge issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome shall communicate details of the plane crash in which lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and another seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot to attempt an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that the conditions of climate were adequate to fly.
"The elements that suggest that the unit had several contacts with soil, the blades had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also informed of the fact that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met the requirements necessary to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the area of impact do not report the emergence of parts on the ground.
"In a search has been reported that there is no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact is presented in a structural manner.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and meet the requirements for the transport.
The ground had a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary provided that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last several months, it may even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director of Airports and Auxiliary Services provided that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the State Presidential Maggiore operated in speed of cruiser and happened on a soft ground upward.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operating cruiser at the time of the impact," he said.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, has listed six important elements in the investigation:
Vol visual:
Normative According to the aircraft, the flight was conducted according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather:
Reports in IMMA mentioned adequate conditions take-off, and as and as the aircraft has progressed towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of clouds at low heights.
Routes selected:
It is likely that "due to conditions of clouds the crew has sought a zone of low height and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
Contact information of the impact and the last registration of the aircraft on radar coincide, probably before the there was no impact or loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of remnants of the aircraft in a small area:
Information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a right track and lateral.
The dispersion model of the aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was hit the ground in terms of structural integrity.
It has not detected traces of fire or explosion:
In the location of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The final results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the soil.
During the field work of parts of the aircraft was found at a height of 9,000,200 feet above mean sea level, the ground had a slope which extends from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it is possibly desarticule throughout its journey.
Information provides elements that suggest that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the soil.
After careful research in an area further that circled the area around the accident, has not been found disperses parts of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity
Social Insurance is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by specialists of the NPI
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that he led an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called protocol'Génétique of obesity of children and adolescents' that will have the markers associated with overweight.
In a press release, the head of the Technical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social support.
This team is supported by experts and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Investigation and Centre for Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
At the investigation should be invited to participate the population with and without right, run for participating sports units of IMSS to Valle de México, where are the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
It stressed that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity is conducted in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de Oriente).
After reaching the goal of having 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation and the e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify among Mexican children and young people of risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As we celebrate the Day on November 14 World Diabetes, he mentioned that the CIHR's aim is to collect three thousand children and young people aged between six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires relating to food.
They will also be requested on their physical activity and their family history of inherited diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or renal failure.
He detailed that Saturdays will be used for all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, height, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (trying to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the product of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'Health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there has been an increase, in the case of boys, the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; as regards the overweight are also observed an increase dramatique', pointed out the specialist of the IMSS.
He indicated that the rationale for the search for markers is based in the fact that the population of the country is different from the other by his genetic history.
He informed that on average, the Mexican had a 65 percent of heredity indo-americaine European, a 30 percent and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability burning the excess energy that we consume (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which can detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila even said that the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the probability of developing metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
Information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors call by writing to parents, which are explained each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they must undertake to prevent the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic conditions: the sedentarism, which is the lack of physical activity daily, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of going off on short distances.
Another issue is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, meat pie to corn flour wrapped in leaves of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signales that the streets were resolved, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, which provided that if the process of construction and maintenance of bituminous deck is adequate, blackcurrants may be reduced or even eliminated entirely.
During its conference A technological opinion on the blackcurrants, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater strength, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera asphalt felt that this type of change could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance, and therefore, the training of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier share oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, the molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltenes, and with a low molecular weight molecules, called malthenes, which together give the paved its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C viscosity is great and to 50 degrees C, presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and shifts during the day depending on the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, including the last three involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones swam in asphalt compacted and later.
Each small stones that form the layer, signalat says, is bounded year asphalt.
When vehicles spend in generating efforts, it provides that the forces spread very well in the streets.
If had of modified asphalt, they propagate better, opinat play the chemical.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, is a final layer called wearing, made in gemstone, i.e., sand which is also steeped in asphalt.
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more than mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and provide adhesion in the street.
As the part of the set that receives and distributes the efforts, the layer of turnover also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they significantly affect the performance of the layer of asphalt.
When the soil is wet, the water runs inside the layer is difficult that it ensure, which softened all layers of pavement and therefore cause of blackcurrants.
In the trial of formation of a blackcurrant, he said, the first to be striker is the film rolling and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the injury did not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement should always be related to the care of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and can repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What has failed the candidate to Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna is not the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 of Princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had simply with the fact of being on the podium of winning money, wear the crown and the band that certifies as new Princess of Colombia.
With the result yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and sceptre, the department amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of a legion of women of Valle del Cauca, who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000) - Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many world is:
What is it has failed? Because the result represents the defeat of a large favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been elected in vain Queen Police and Best Face Jolie to Vogue, securities obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor considered in the decision by the jury of the designate First Princess is the fact that it was not satisfied with her answer to the question "? What was the book that has marked and why? posed by Martín Gómez, Murillo of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of final culturaliser, I think the book that marked my childhood is" Little Prince ", a book is deep enough.
Now I read "Crime and punishment" is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The fervor of the blood."
This response did not please firstly due to "be culturaliser" and secondly for not specifically explain how each book cited the had marked.
But Melina said at the end of the ceremony that she felt quiet and happy with the outcome "the universe and wise, it is what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Between the assumptions launched is that Valle was destroyed by patronage.
A journalist in Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the highly acclaimed and the candidate who received all preliminary price (challenge gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best costume craft, and Queen Mother), "that woke the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not conspicuous on the stage."
It is noted that in his first presentation in bathing suit at the beach of Hilton and its two parades of the eve of the coronation.
Although both parades it seemed sure of itself, it was noted that it did not have the strength and energy of representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the program "Como en casa" (As at home), Canal NCR stated that the fact that Melina was designated Princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the price for the competition is not the crown of Queen."
Moreover, Valle has avoided the press to the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the board on its interest in the social initiatives, that is the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed in relation to the social needs of the country.
"Only beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It also speculates that Valle has sinned by its defects behind and the fibrosis that was in her abdomen, but this is contradictory precisely because the board elected as the candidate'Beauté Natural healthier with the body, good food and physical work responsible.
The preparer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina had not the best body, that it was best, "but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well-known, it left marks the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgery she had undergone.
"The surgery are good, but Valle failed to make them.
Her body was never his strength and she lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Beauty Competition provides for the first time, after the parade in swimwear has is a cruel prediction that took place yesterday evening, we said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was to Melina for not giving him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of rule, not as sovereign, or as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competitions by designation of National Competition.
However, it will be in history as one of the queens that despite its dazzling passage by Cartagena, has not received the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali which identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali rose to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste ITC of Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme commander of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano," considering its fingerprints.
The seven dactyloscopistes ITC working in the field, this week it was the turn of 'call' Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who worked for 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.
Early in his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the corpses that were to be identified.
The year 2000 was transferred to the capital of Valle and after following appropriate courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something of very large the expected.
Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and it was suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the guerrilla world's oldest, therefore asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognized by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
It had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a sampling and a lantern, Eliazar has compared the corpse's fingerprints with those of the card.
His eye misled him not: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme commander of the Farc.
In research of the footprint
For a Sijín dactyloscopiste of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
Many of people is not our work.
The fingerprinting is an exact science, without any margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identify bodies, the dactyloscopistes support the investigations for crimes such as theft and manslaughter and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many offenders are of false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and seek in the database.
The researcher told that flight in a case it had to remove part of a wall of a house, because in this area the thief had supported his hand to break a safe full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not of adequate areas to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who participated to different flights," he remembers.
The fingerprints can also exclude or confirm the suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently a man was found dead, with bottles of beverage around him.
For interlude of the investigation it was determined that a parent can be suspect of crime and indeed a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if No. guarantees it the murderer, that the place on the crime scene.
A dactyloscopiste ITC explained that "the fingerprints is extracted from objects with physical or chemical reagents."
Where they occur, using a sampling or a band for the levy.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declinquents, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombian," indicated the ITC expert.
He explained that it is not how it is shown in the television program CSI.
As all that glitters is not gold, all that it comes is not necessarily a footprint.
It may, however, be used, if you realize the confrontation necessary.
"Outraged" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators overwhelmed before the place Zuccotti for camping.
Much of people acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The integral of movement occupies Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York while trying to re-enter, through a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators overwhelmed before the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to access through a judicial order that allows'indignés' camp again in this area, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there has been new judgments.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," dit-un spokespersons of the movement "occupies Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of'indignés' evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibits the forced evacuation of the area and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
Moreover, the'indignés' have occupied a new central park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, property of the Parish of Trinity Church.
At least during a time they have managed to occupy the place, but after the Police is moved and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray was unable to confirm the fact that concrete figures, ensuring Efe he saw some journalists which was also from handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are old people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene for them before the police.
Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti, which is a forum for private property, remains closed pending the conclusion of a court hearing under this Tuesday during which must review the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some demonstrators displaced so far were at that time and distributed copies of the judiciary and they were even to agents who monitored the place, which has caused'certains small affrontements', "said Bray, who denounced the fact that some official hit the demonstrators.
The law prohibits authorities to evacuate members of occupies Wall Street or to apply'lois published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit the demonstrators for new access to park with tents or other properties that they heard of used ago'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this law, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, which it was alerted to the fact that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councillor has personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn to the place Zuccotti, an operation during which has arrested 200 people and which was committed to the fact that the demonstrators'violaient the law ".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was "a place in which people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people," because "some outlets had received threats" and the residents were afraid "to their quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repugnant and Bloomberg shows that the committee is more concerned to defend the financial interests than those of American workers," said the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respect freedom of expression."
The responsible for "occupies Wall Street" also indicated that they do not hold "major actions" to Thursday in collaboration with community-based organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protestes, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Noel
At side of Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, it will be in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next December 1
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen of "Home Improvement," aid in "Baywatch," rabbit in "Playboy," wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special program on Canadian television.
The private channel CTV Television announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, will be in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has distributed today images of television program in which Anderson, also known for the private wide dissemination on the Internet of a pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at the time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in supporting in a nursery a doll representing to Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous comedian Canadian of Indian origin who recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph.
Apart from Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel of CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March was married to Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and which is itself not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called'pute' American Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Returns after the earthquake
GDP increase a 1.5% through domestic consumption and put an end to the spiral of decline in the beginning of March
Since the month of March, the Japanese economy was still paralysed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake which became Japanese nuclear crisis, the country's worst disaster since the Second World War.
The Government of Tokyo's first estimates have calculated the material losses to 300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global environment, seems to be mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the GDP data between July and September were used to definitively turn the page: GDP increased a 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6 percent annual rate.
The recorded the second quarter, for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012, requires, in addition, the greatest rate of increase since the period of January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of acquisition of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of increases non-interrompue.
However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy not based exclusively on the Keynesian stimulus that invite everyone to take advantage of the crisis to build, or rebuild, the infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan woke up mainly through the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents the Japanese 60% of GDP.
This variable increased 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo recovered the internal market when the Japanese yen -- the currency -- has become a "refuge" elected by the investors fleeing the values in eurozone debt crisis and the unrest forecasts of United States, a privilege that is like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divides, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country with a floating line is determined by the economic health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decline custody.
"Follow the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicated that the majority of member countries have submitted in September of clearer signals of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are limited.
Because it fell four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been under of the average, which is in the 100 level, n dropping eight digits to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds of new the doubts
Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign no written commitment
With risk premiums peripheral triggered uncertainty and resettled in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that led to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The sensation that the "consensus" of the new Greek Government of transition is imposed by the requirements of Brussels rather than a real belief of political forces is to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days set in its designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated its demand for new elections for the scheduled dates, that of 19 February.
"The main task of the Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday when he opened a parliamentary debate that will tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras No. identifies the doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader went one step further in its pulse that EU and IMF, the organizations to release the 8,000 million that Athens needs urgently, and said clearly that it will not approve any letter of commitment of adjustments.
But the European Commission, still upset by the impact caused by the referendum of va-tout Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that the requirement is firm: it does provide assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign a "written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors back "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is a definitive date either.
The Greek still have much to do.
The Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for the progress and hope"
The Queen stresses the place "predominant" of Spain with regard to the type of financial
Spain "has achieved a prominent place at the global level in the role of Micro-finances."
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the past two decades the second donor in the world in relation to this instrument of cooperation which "gasoline" lies in the fact that it is a "tool for the social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in humans."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-e World Summit of Microcredit to Valladolid with certainty that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and "very special, in that a goal the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes below a dollar per day, which is set the" poverty line ".
Spain "continues to work to expand the network of" beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with" responsibility, "said the Queen Sofía, which had hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women ", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many objectives" and "we are facing a lot of challenges."
The of Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which it must promote "two basic purposes."
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families which have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of poverty in which they now live.
The impetus in the development of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the trail initiated a few years ago to pioneer a way" by Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen Sofía as "an act of justice and due recognition."
And she described the father of this instrument as an "idealistic admirable in the global cause of poverty reduction," the work which it is since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in every meeting I have seen a continuing evolution," said Her Majesty, including the relationship with this project provided yesterday the adjective "head of family" meeting at Valladolid by the "banquer of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofía has finished his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Imperative ethics"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that "solidarity is an ethics imperative" for any democratic State.
In this regard, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is "a permanent obligation."
Jiménez considered that the microcredit involves "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not leave that it is the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to provide "confidence" to persons "excluded for all close the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the attendees in a city that "contaminated opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity."
European The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage
The first day of the convention of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, was held without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally in the program but has imposed in the fall, including to meet the activists who consider government policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow of Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes that were right, on the basis of their interventions, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, very Europhile Wolfgang Schäuble, the Finance Minister, left no room for doubt.
The core of the Chancellor, and of the motion -- is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe.
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time is ripe for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe."
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress which the inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Course, it is unlikely that the 27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is asked.
Similarly, delegates rejected the proposal by an overwhelming majority to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank in terms of the weight of each economy, which obviously was to strengthen Germany's weight.
To defuse the climate inside of his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but has not sought to win its conference on the back of "smaller" European countries or the countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
In recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
Indeed, this was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is the fraud to judgments disease?
After allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the sickness absence.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a body of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the recurring theme, since 2007, of the fight against fraud and social assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which share a willingness to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on sickness absence.
First in an aim of budgetary savings: the government intends to impose on private employees of a fourth day of waiting before the takeover of a stoppage of work.
In clear, specific business without agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, therefore at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that risk to generate anger, but that would be EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, of scope more symbolic: impose to officials a day of uncompensated deficiency in event of a work stoppage (they have so far not waiting period, against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunch the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuse work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you reimburse," warned Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL, Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to work stoppages.
This is in fact the subject since 2002 of a constant monitoring and offensive policies, who most often borne fruit.
The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
We first on the national figures a moment.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than EUR 237 million daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in health economics, the per diem in 2008 accounted for 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity leave and occupational accidents, sickness and 54 percent related to, or EUR 6.2 billion.
So 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French have experienced an average of 14.5 days' absence from work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting group.
An average that conceals some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any day of sickness.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, said that in 2010, 37% of the judgments were disease for a period of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% above.
When compared with their European neighbors, the French workers are no more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for reasons of health or not) was, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud to judgments disease represents very little deal with black labor.
With regard to fraud, it is only a small scale.
Strengthening of legislation since 2002 is that systematic controls are on the judgments of disease more than 45 days.
In 2008, on 1.5 million, controls the CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 made for short-term judgments were "unjustified or too long," or 37,050 cases.
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases "inappropriate or unjustified" on 1.2 million, is 132,000.
In total, therefore 169,000 cases "unjustified," for millions of employees having a sick.
A figure that represents little face, for example, to the undeclared work.
The MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would be 9 to 15 billion euros in lost tax revenue per year, more than the total cost of per diems, and therefore much more that fraud in the past.
Papadémos: Greece will implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new adjustment program to restore its economy.
It is what said Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos, before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be able to accomplish this task.
"To continue the recovery efforts of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of fiscal adjustment," said the head of the government, who pronounced his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Mr. Papadémos has projected that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "around nine percent" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been of 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 percent in 2009.
The right denied the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed Monday his support to the measures already approved to try to find a way out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not on an additional austerity.
"We shall not be voting in favor of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
It has agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and to combat the waste but hostile to any policy that would hinder the economic recovery.
A Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and EU debloqueraient not necessary the loan of EUR 8 billion without written assurances from all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras responded that its floor was sufficient and that it would be nothing under external pressure.
It must legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of the death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denial of the death.
Only 9% of Canadians are indeed to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take provisions to this effect.
It is one of the findings of an extensive report of the Royal Society of Canada, attended by six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the choice is required, with a patient found competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, the experts cited a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of the death in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to address the topic of death."
Médicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we hear the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital.
Overall, the country, it is in Quebec that the rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said would not change the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Or, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries in which these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization lead to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not consenting.
Instead, said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, would be many more cases of these excesses specifically in the country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people in end of life to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia would not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled persons is of less value.
For those who performed the assisted suicide, 41% surveyed feel that they should not be prosecuted.
In peacekeeping or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
As, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals are trained to abide by a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond cases of cancer.
Finally, in the area of palliative sedation or terminal, already widely used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and it is subject to the same procedures.
Reservations other experts
Some experts in the field of the right to health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts' report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the signatories of the experts report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask to have it assistance to commit suicide," said Mr. Deschamps, who visited yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the individual above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
Or, in society, "he said, there are signs and constraints."
The health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which it referred to as "power clear pro-euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, which is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contested in particular the data of the report regarding the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, is in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan called on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounced a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad expressed yesterday in the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, their resistance and denounced a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria from the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while neighbouring Turkey and Jordan, to Syria, took position in favor of a departure of President Assad.
Yesterday King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "step down" in Syria, where more than 40 civilians and members of the forces of the regime have been killed.
"If Bashar had his country's best interest at heart, he should resign, but it should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King of Jordan, a neighbor of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have resulted in a failure.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot meet the will," he said, referring to Syria, neighbouring countries in respect of which Turkey adopted an increasingly hard line.
The United States in turn welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime," after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey adopt a tone of increasingly hard facing repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime perished in the region of Deraa, in the south of Syria, said the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians were killed "in exchange of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem had estimated that the country was "directed towards the end of the crisis."
It has also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus of its work, which he claims is "a dangerous step."
Syria "does not shrink," he added, assuring that "the plots hatched against Syria will fail."
After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is to present a "mechanism of protection of civilians" and to the shipment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers in the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé was also expressed in favor of sending observers for the United Nations to help protect the civilians of the regime's repression that is locked up in the "paranoia."
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities affected by the dispute and the release of demonstrators arrested.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while keeping to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices by the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has claimed a little time for markets to form his team and implement a program, containing "sacrifices" in order to recover the lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before today to meet with the unions and the employers.
It should put in place a relatively small firm composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, MP for one of the many small groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has for its part said expect Mario Monti sought by Friday a vote of confidence in parliament to ensure that the new government has a sufficient support.
The consultations will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti a short list, perhaps a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti said nervousness of stock markets and bond yesterday, asking the time.
In "democracy, there are specific time" to prepare a government and its program, he said, is "confident that the markets will be patient and understanding."
His designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
Designated Prime Minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies."
The new government must last until 2013, when the next parliamentary elections, he said.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti is committed, once entered into service, to work in an emergency and in the goal that Italy "protagonist" in Europe again.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy doesn't change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budget balance by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, requested in particular new austerity measures.
The "boss of bosses" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who discussed Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "as a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit."
Mr. Monti, known for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme," the "teacher" symbolizing "the serious challenge" and "another Italy," according to the editorial.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would avoid early elections, as Italy must place by April 2012 to EUR 200 billion of government bonds.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a nuclear detonator usable with a weapon, said Monday a US NGOs specialized in the nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Nuclear Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher.
IAEA expressed the last week of its "serious concerns" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
The ISIS drawing widely in documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of its society have led to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
It then cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA cited "strong evidence that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system" "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only familiar with this technique, but, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his country of origin."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and offences increased by 50%
Crimes and offences against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence have slightly decreased or little progress, according to the FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 percent, against an increase of 13 percent of violence against Catholics, a decline of 4% of crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 percent of crimes and offences anti-religieux.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, including 47.3 percent motivated by differences of race and 20 percent by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," said the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered as a serious violation of human rights," said one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to address these abuses," he said, estimating that it could go through an improvement of police reports on the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in the federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color of skin, religion, the origin and now gender.
Twitter changes its platform and is more similar to Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced Monday for changes in the format of its platform, in particular to enable its users to monitor the activity of those they follow, which resembles his a little more service than Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" track more clearly, the online activity of other "Twittos," users which follows the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This enables them to learn whether they are forwarding messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have any favorite messages, etc..
This new formula of Twitter was tested on "a small percentage of users in August" before being distributed to the entire network Monday, indicated to the AFP the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its functioning little instinctive, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) that the happiness of insiders, and opens to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were sliced through "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It is unnecessary, invasive, and it is too similar to Facebook," wrote @ jemb123.
"The Activity functionality will help me to better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream," sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Inclusion of a fiscal "golden rule" in the constitution
The/Christian Social Democratic government of grand coalition in power in Austria Tuesday decided to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" to reduce the budget deficit and avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had even announced this decision on the basis of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is of 74.6%, well above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest in more each year," argued the Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria and responds to a request from the member countries of the euro zone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the registration by the end of 2012 to the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in legislation of equal value.
The system adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model," Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year of 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, beginning in 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and the municipalities to submit budgets to the balance.
The objective is to get to the 2020/21 public debt below the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threat of a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen would continue to rise.
"We speak as we did the last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen was not far from historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
This day, Tokyo has sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had just set a new record of force since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen is regularly since recovered, boosted by the acquisition of investors as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is passed Tuesday in the 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic barrier of 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago because it said the cost of products made in Japan and reduced the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when converted into national currency.
"Japan fight to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), Mr Noda said that fears that the rise of the yen does not kill the fragile recovery in the bud.
The third global economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the quarter precedent- for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption sealed by the disaster.
But Prime Minister found that the high cost of yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has for its part called the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken "appropriate measures," suggesting that no further monetary easing was to wait Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Institute increased emission of 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury bonds, bringing to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling amounts of its procurement of various financial securities for flooding the market with liquidity.
Euro zone:
Rates rise, the Awards flanchent
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still mine the European indexes.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rate of vulnerable countries continue their ascent.
Also worried about the stability of the euro area, the European stock markets sink in a little more negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and 0.1%. London
"With the new tensions on the bond yields of troubled eurozone states, the equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional dealer at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7 percent, with its round of renewed fears of market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of changes as the investors will not have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concerns about the future of the euro penalises the single currency, which continued its decline Tuesday.
The euro evolves at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Towards 10:00 a.m., the European currency is 1.3570 dollar, declining by 0.4%.
According brokers, it fell after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, convened a conference Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to exit the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates well in excess of 6%
The borrowing rate of Italy and Spain remain at alarming levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85% 6.2%, the Spanish securities of the same maturity.
These tensions on interest rates in the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future government Italian Mario Monti called time for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the firing line of markets, while held Sunday of parliamentary elections in the country.
The rate gap ("spread" between the obligations to 10 years of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high.
Pending receipt of the figures for growth of the euro area
Côté statistics, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3 percent expected, driven by household consumption.
INSEE was revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And, it is the fourth most concern, the economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5 percent over the same period.
A first estimate for the whole of the euro area is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission is to warn against the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy:
The facts should prevail on the dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed based on considerations of short term or the subject of the "emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and the cost of the electricity directly affect the purchasing power and on the competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an electoral rendezvous is the opportunity to think about these issues and to the place that is the nuclear.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, sound data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet ", the" demographic changes will result in a doubling of demand "electricity by 2050, unless to deprive a huge part of the global population of a vital element.
At the same time, it must address the depletion of fossil resources to continue to produce the "power continuously, without forgetting the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes his to the need to find a source of replacement able to substitute, or of Switzerland, just not to build the latest generation of nuclear power plants.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name only a few, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, meanwhile, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their Central Park with the construction of a suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality frustrates the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the rise of the price of the "electricity, exacerbated by the increased energy dependency on imported gas, in particular Russia, a leap of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of coal and gas-fired plants.
In a few months, all of these adverse effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to ponder.
Champion of Europe of the wind ", which takes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind, under which its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a bill ("power 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of the "energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the" the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear would create a strong increase in the price of the "illusory electricity, which would make the declarations on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French are unwilling to pay, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, the surveys show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has helped to build an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs created.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs on international markets and makes them very creative source of jobs that cannot be relocated.
If France were to decide to leave the nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs in reducing as shrinking the EUR 6 billion annual export French d "nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician commission a PRT designed to operate 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
For resolve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there is no source of production of "miracle power, any more than there is of evil.
The development by Areva of low CO2 emitting solutions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementarity of d "energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We in France a Safety Authority which control strict and transparent on existing plants and in the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the reactor design and unforgivable human error caused the tragedy.
A Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
Fruit of this approach and of a cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the PRT is a design making it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wanted to build a powerhouse, the cessation of its construction in Flamanville is a magnificent gift to competitors of Areva and EDF in leaving the way open to capture the key leadership role in the development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the "emotion, the dogmas and the partisan tactics dominate a debate as critical for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles -engorgement of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment which are against foreign students that was in the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming the passage that France "does not need foreign talent, masonry and of restaurant servers."
But it is rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
A right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with almost 2 million migrant workers," and left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the poverty of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
For both sides, the immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we daignera grant towards immigrants.
In its program, François Holland is limited to the trivial, indicating that co-development will solve the migration problem. ""
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps pay electoral advantage; but it is economically very costly.
As the recall economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the experts on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration growth and anemia night to employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may have to substitute for national workers, especially the unskilled, exerting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are much complementary rather than substitutes for national employees, acting for most of the trades in shortage areas of employment.
Immigrants low-skilled work in sectors that do not attract the national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that suffers a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows increases between 0.6 and 0.9% of long-term real wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized American among Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The International Labor Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average over the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to, at the beginning of the mandate, fetching missing points of growth "with teeth."
Teeth in question, as to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, remains to think European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a very sensitive.
The European continent should be borne in mind that, to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, of totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but Salazar, Franco in Spain, in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient, for democracy triomphat permanently of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and for the exercise of the most direct way that is.
Are known, since Napoleon "the Petit," that it was a facility for thought.
The universal suffrage, to be a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be "instrument of oppression" as said once the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, of the Enlightenment, of solidarity, a social and economic justice.
The crisis of Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is equally first and a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodie of vrai-faux Greek referendum has been revealing in this respect of double value: the need for a strong return of policy, but also the sense of disturbing its inability, for its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic battle are now displaced, and that, for many of them, the Republicans no longer have troops in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demand a succession of national referendums, organized in an ad hoc and piecemeal.
A licence to European absolute monarch or a jump to feet in the vacuum of the nationalist reaction: the choice for the citizen.
No cut-off, we do not want any but a common exercise, as of right, calm and continuous, the choice and of democracy, this time at European level.
There is no of crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal-cannot be more where stop l "list, because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole which pander to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its helplessness and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole which is humiliated on the international scene.
There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that loses its sovereignty, gently and with it each of its nations.
The urgency, is to restore the popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
Because it together, that Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After long fought this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, the world needs today the European economic government.
Either.
But the thinking without strong political and democratic integration, and seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new stalemate.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" of Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe on the economic plan.
This can only be done in building a more democratic Europe politically, a real European popular sovereignty.
In order to Europe, making Europeans.
The "contactless" smart cards become widespread
The World show of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to complete on an increase of 11 percent of global sales of smart cards (bank card, phone SIM card...), to more than 6 billion, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The segment most enabling contactless is technology that allows to pay the transit or to settle its purchases simply by approaching the a card reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, compared with 320 million a year earlier.
Their share should further progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart card (6.925 million cards).
Long the laggard of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the payment without contact.
Approximately 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals to accept the.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But mass merchandisers are the very hard.
Carrefour has thus issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To move to the gear, it is now that the banks are their clients.
"Two major French institutions are committed to disseminate to the future systematically equipped for the bank cards to their clients without contact," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the technology NFC (Near Field Communication) necessary to conduct transactions.
"They are lagging behind."
"But they should finally have a real growth the next year."
"We are building on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Agriculture Credit Bank yesterday announced the launch of a test from December to June to Caen.
The iPhone about 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a case authorizing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale, too, said yesterday for the placing on the market of an offer that allows clients to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Western Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram.
Soupçonnés long-standing, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
Sunday, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers was now "satisfied."
"The manner in which the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation," he said without further detail.
Paris seems to be a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered bridges.
They are kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the following day with several of their abductors during an operation by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the French investigators and Niger should find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The analysis of calls towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular concern to the investigators: one leads to a Niger which has been extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who was close to Aqmi and of the sect.
"It is a step forward, but it should probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," moderating Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These months "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its procedures, which include the use of suicide bombers or explosives of increasingly complex and as well as those used by invoice Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated little of interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 to Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and of the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in Hausa, advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is a rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia law while its militants committed the fight against the central government impious.
These are first of all churches, bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram are particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations.
The Abuja reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested living, is killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will radicalize and leave its northern strongholds.
At last Christmas, it claims an attack that left 80 dead in Jos, and another in Abuja.
In June, is still in Abuja that Boko Haram is in control of the police headquarters in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which operating from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria concerned now all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all information."
The world according to the Republican candidates to the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and compete of simplistic and ignorance.
Could America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters may believe.
Since few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other increasing the rhetoric and the shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans, often unsubstantiated, abound.
Mitt Romney, the best positioned in the race to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party," has threatened to drag China before the WTO and to cause "for manipulation of their currency," a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of large parts of its industry to Asia.
Both worse if it must involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former China Ambassador of Obama and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed strangle face an attitude that "proud" the emotions.
It called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who sits in the depths of the polls, remains muted.
At the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to curb its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he fanfaronne."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
It has also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations to the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second the best placed candidate, has about it an embarrassing lack of records.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capability," apparently unaware of the fact that China holds the atom military since 1964.
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and to strikes against Iran, is willing, however, to commit the US army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in its wine in terms of counter-terrorism.
They rightly stress the failure of its naive dialogue with Iran, on the departure over-hasty of "boys" of Iraq, on its procrastination in Libya, to sticky and a small label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population is rather positive Obama's national security record, which eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it is wary of military intervention that led to the stalemate.
And, arguing that he must rebuild economically the America to resurrect its leadership, Obama is more fair.
Nord Stream, new door of ntree of Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia in from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with flashing.
Over 500 guests including four Heads of State and of Government participated, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and buffet end, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline linking directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Netherlands counterpart Mark Rutte have turned all the steering wheel of the valve commander the entry of Russian gas in the European network.
With this new pipeline, additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km linking the region of St. Petersburg to the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed end 2012, to issue a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of the French consumption.
And already discussing the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge project has the air of victory.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossing by a third country (Poland and Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a bit of their power: it becomes more difficult for them, to Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to take Poland, in 1939.
It is whether the topic is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, through its support to the Russian draft, is earned greater security of its supplies.
But it is the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between Europeans of the East and West.
Russia has succeeded, in just five years, upholding its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strong consumers of gas, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us to organically," confirmed François Fillon in inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which major gas contracts are also political and economic.
This explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, the destination of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The steel tube submarine is gaine of concrete to protect against ships' anchors.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, to 200 m in length.
For the building, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A 100 had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
It was also necessary to strengthen the measures to protect flora and fauna.
The heavy metal tube is a long snake, as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops along its entire length: or valve, or station maintenance.
Control A platform was expected off the coast of Sweden, but the project were abandoned while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Crown corporation Russian settle permanently off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," said Jens Muller.
In case of leakage, the gas content in the pipeline therefore escapes in the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by builders who have planned the welds to hear a flight every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a machine that circulates within the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced to the tube, wide of a metre in diameter, and is driven by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 metres second, it provides specific information on any deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without the slightest compensation.
The gas flow is simply provided by the pressure.
It is 200 bars in the departure, and 100 to the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51 percent of the shares.
With are joined the German E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for a renewable period of twenty years, all of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of gas really moved," said Jens Muller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are safe to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine.
The valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gas which may, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas with each hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a book of mark.
Created a dozen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine to restore the taste of the writing.
It smacks of adventures, of hours to write in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its rectangular black cover, elastic, leaves an off-white color, as aged by the time.
However, the Carnet Moleskine as we know today was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time of launch of a notebook design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is based on an ancient production, the mole skin (skin mole) which means a cotton varnish used to cover of seats by example.
This type of book was highly prized by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has returned to the fore an object old and forgotten, that was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, now the head of the mark in Modo Modo.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26% to $12.7 million pieces passed.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a composite drawing of the buyer, as the Notebook won both the businessman that the student and the professionals.
At the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and grown.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its infancy, in nearly 100 today and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, of the Fnac to small shops in the downtown core and was able to impose its identity.
"We followed the air time and this new requirement of writing, despite the rise of e-mail," says Maria Sebregondi.
This signature cultural with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists present their own book.
In August, it also launched coverage in leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this will be cultural, Moleskine has succeeded in diversifying its products: bags, agenda, pens, covers computer... The mark is on a wide range of materials.
A success that made the envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund .10 Capital Europe today, Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities remains so high?
Approximately 19% of persons with disabilities are in search of a job.
The 15th week for employment of disabled persons is today.
Despite a proactive policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, against 9 percent for the whole population.
Décourageant?
No, "said Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for employment of disabled persons."
"Progress since 15 years are considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times."
"There is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for persons with disabilities, remain many barriers to access to employment.
They are older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the pan and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for persons with disabilities, against 38 percent on average.
In short, all criteria that significantly complicate the return to employment, and that "are the crux of the problem," said Christian Grapin, Director General of Springboard, an association created in 1992 to help firms to hire disabled workers.
Is for the brakes objectives.
Remains the unsaid, changing attitudes, but too slowly.
A survey conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the City indicated that managers interviewed "a low level of awareness of disability," with a "overrepresentation of persons in wheelchairs, persons with mental or intellectual disabilities."
Outcome, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employment of 6% of workers with disabilities, set in an Act of 1987.
The latest figures available, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3 percent," said Pierre White, Director General of the Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of institutions "taxed," as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and of 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased the contributions, has created a strong pressure on the businesses," said Pierre White."
"But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of firms with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What of happiness"
Prior to face the Blues Tuesday evening (8.45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens has not hidden the pleasure that gives them this friendly match.
It will not to write that there was complicity between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after attacking the mood of its action against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has only praise to make on it.
"I am very pleased to be Eden, of its progress and the fact that it is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says of his side the Lillois.
As the contrastre between its benefits in club and selection, "is a whole, it is justified."
"A Lille, I am throughout the year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Ménagé against Romania Friday evening for the match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for finally "shine."
Without fail, however, the concept of "fun."
The Blues, it encouraged since the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been bear," he says.
That is to further strengthen the "character" of this meeting.
Moreover, in front, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he said.
"It sat in a moment."
"Power play against them, it is only the happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for its part referred to the "pride."
"Pride" to contest "a gala match."
"Pride" also to see-as a "neighbor," that France is "once again a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc made a work of thunder," he enthused.
While Belgium will the next Euro, the technician would be well share the air with the Blues direction. Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are major," he said.
It is in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will report at the next matches." The against France included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal Paulo Bento began with many optimistic its dam return to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the go, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy."
Paulo Bento had been already, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not a shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which is to lever since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to rip down.
In view of the match go (0-0) Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears clear that the games are not facts.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, but he was unable to score that goal if valuable, that would have relieved.
"It is a good result, which are, however, some risk because we have not been of purpose outside"
But among them, in the light of the Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to move, before an audience that should also be boiling, even if the party is obviously "very tight," told by a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are quite confident to take the upper hand," said the Portuguese coach for 42 years.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," still placed Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The zero reported Friday in Bosnia requires the Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero may be sufficient to Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It is a good result, which are, however, some risk because we have not been to but outside," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualifications and have players with a lot of individual qualifications," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have entry intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to reflect."
A good idea, provided to be realistic, this time.
